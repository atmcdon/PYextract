6.8.2,,"AGRs should serve at least 24 months in their present position to be considered for a  MDR. MDRs with less than 24 months in current assignment require waiver approval by TAG  or CG, or designee."
6.8.3,,AGR Airmen who decline a MDR will be released from the AGR program no earlier  than 90 days after the date they decline. Airmen who desire to be released earlier than 90 days  must make a written request through their chain of command to the HRO.
6.9,,"Key Staff Assignments.  A key staff position is a dual status, managerial position which the  incumbent is a member of the immediate staff of the state Adjutant General, or the Commanding  General, or who serves under direct supervision of TAG or CG. TAG or the CG has the authority  to non-competitively appoint AGR Airmen in order to accommodate either an “overarching  military consideration” or a military assignment at the key staff level. Key staff positions are  identified by NGB-J1-TCP."
6.10,,"Details.  Details are one-time, short-term assignments designed to meet an emergent need.  AGR Airmen detailed outside their AFSC will not be detailed for more than 120 days within a  four-year period. Consecutive or “back-to-back” details are prohibited. All details must be  coordinated with and monitored by the HRO or AGR Manager."

7.1,,"Promotions.  The grades of Senior Master Sergeant, Chief Master Sergeant, Major,  Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel are congressionally controlled in accordance with 10 USC §  12011 and 10 USC § 12012. Promotion to these controlled grades cannot exceed the annually  established military duty end-strength or grade ceilings or the individual controlled grade  allocation provided to each respective state (reference Chapter 13 of this instruction). Therefore,  the following controls are necessary:"
7.1.1,,"Officer and enlisted AGR personnel selected for promotion must be the sole occupant  of a higher-grade UMD full-time funded position prior to assuming the new grade. Promotion  opportunity is limited to the authorized grade on the incumbent’s current AGR position as  reflected on the programmed UMD. By law, officers not occupying a higher-grade position, or  constrained by controlled grade limitation, may not assume the new grade."
7.1.1.1,,"Example:  A major cannot be position-vacancy promoted to lieutenant colonel if  the authorized grade on the UMD AGR position is major. To advance/further promotion  opportunity, the individual must find a different AGR job with greater responsibility and  higher authorized military grade."
7.1.1.2,,Example:  A major can be position-vacancy promoted to lieutenant colonel if the  authorized grade on their UMD AGR position is lieutenant colonel or higher.
7.1.2,,"Officers selected for promotion under Reserve Officer Promotion Management Act  (ROPMA) can only be promoted within the state’s controlled-grade ceilings. The availability  of a controlled grade and an assignment in a funded, AGR position on the UMD (RIC “0034”  or “0148”) will be determining factors. Promotions will be involuntarily delayed, indefinitely,  if a controlled grade is not available. Reference AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation  and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force for additional guidance. If a  controlled grade (O-5) is available, an officer promoted under ROPMA may be assigned as an  overgrade in an O-4 position on the UMD in accordance with DAFI 36-2110."
7.1.2.1,,"The promotion is considered involuntarily delayed due to controlled grade  limitations in accordance with 10 USC § 14311. When the controlled grade becomes  available, the officer may assume the higher grade."
7.1.2.2,,"Pending the availability of a controlled grade in the promoted rank, TAG or CG  may permit the overgrade assignment of an AGR officer selected under ROPMA in  accordance with DAFI 36-2110. AGR officers may be retained until their completion of  20 years TAFMS and attained three years' time-in-grade, or until they reach their MSD,  whichever is earliest."

7.6.4,,RSD does not count towards the 40-hour work week commitment.
7.6.5,,"AGR Airmen are available for duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week; therefore,  compensatory time-off for duties performed in excess of established working hours is not  authorized. However, Airmen who earn the privilege may be granted a special pass in  accordance with DAFI 36-3003."
7.7,,Supervision of Personnel.  The concept of the senior military individual being assigned  supervisory responsibilities is an essential element of military service and an inherent part of the  military organizational structure. Supervisory authority for AGR Airmen shall correspond to  military operational lines of authority.
7.7.1,,Commanders will maintain unity of command and integrity of supervisory  relationships. Military rank is the determining factor when designating supervisory  responsibilities. Grade inversion is detrimental to the military nature of the ANG and is not  authorized.

An example is as follows: “AGR  Airman will convert to Title 10 USC Section 12301(d) in support of OPERATION  ENDURING FREEDOM from 15 January 2009 to 26 May 2009, GMAJCOM: ACC.”  If the  GMAJCOM releases the AGR Airman from Title 10 duty sooner than original expiration day,  an amendment to to the ANG Form 1299 must reflect the appropriate end date of the Title 10  duty."
7.8.2.1,,"The ANG Form 1299. This form must be completed by the unit, certified by the  AGR member’s commander, and provided to the FSS for the member’s record to be  updated in MilPDS and for assistance accomplishing the necessary DD Form 214.  Examples of missions that may require an AGR to perform occasional Title 10 duty/day(s)  include but are not limited to: Aerospace Control Alert (ACA), North East Tanker Task  Force (NETTF), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)/Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)  (such as Predator, Reaper, Global Hawk), Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS),  State Partnership Program (SPP), etc."

Note: the  only exception being lawfully appointed Dual Status Commanders."
7.8.4,,"An AGR member on Title 10 active duty orders must primarily support the active duty  mission, and any Title 32 business conducted should be incidental to the primary support of  the Title 10 federal mission."
7.8.5,,Title 10 activations (voluntary or involuntary mobilization) of AGR members are  normally in support of Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations for contingency  operations. Title 10 activations of 365 days are beyond the intent and purpose of the AGR  program.

DoDI 1215.06, Uniform Reserve, Training, and Retirement Categories for the Reserve   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  33  Components, provides that Airmen must be in Title 10 status when outside the United States, its  Territories, and possessions. Title 32 ANG AGR members may have to travel outside the United  States, its Territories, and possessions in connection with their AGR duties (e.g., AEF Rotations,  State Partnership Program Director). In such cases by accepting entry into the AGR program, the  Airman consents to being automatically converted to Title 10 status under 10 USC § 12301(d) or  10 USC § 10147 (as applicable) for the duration of the OCONUS duty while retaining their status  as AGRs during this period. Therefore, all AGR orders upon acceptance of an AGR tour will  include the mandatory remarks outlined in paragraph 6.1.2."

7.10,,Emergency Domestic and “Immediate Response” Situations.
7.10.1,,Emergency Situations. States should be cognizant of the fact that using AGR Airmen  for emergency domestic situations has fiscal law and Anti-Deficiency Act implications and  must be governed judiciously.
7.10.1.1,,"When an AGR Airman’s unit is ordered to operational 32 USC § 502(f)(2), 32  USC § 502(a), or State Active Duty (SAD) status to support an emergency domestic  situation, the AGR Airman may accompany his or her unit and continue to perform his or  her normal AGR duties."
7.10.1.2,,"Since AGR duty is year-round military duty, and AGR Airman may not, by  taking leave, be placed in another military status."
7.10.1.3,,"If an AGR Airman has a critical skill set that may be needed by another unit, that  AGR Airman may be attached to the deploying unit if no other reasonable option exits."
7.10.1.4,,This authority applies to individual AGR Airmen and does not constitute  authority to cross-level significant numbers of AGR Airmen from non-deploying units to  deploying units.
7.10.1.5,,Support of the operation or mission must be to the extent that doing so does not  interfere with the performance of his or her primary AGR duties.
7.10.1.6,,"For units composed entirely of AGRs and established by law to perform specific  functions in response to specific emergency domestic situations, such as Civil Support  Teams (CST), response to those contingency situations by performing those functions falls  within their normal AGR duties and a request from the President or Secretary of Defense  is not required to provide this operational response."
7.10.2,,"“Immediate Response” Situations. “Immediate Response Authority” is defined by  DoDD 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) as, “A Federal military  commander’s, DoD Component Head’s, and/or responsible DoD civilian official’s authority  temporarily to employ resources under their control, subject to any supplemental direction  provided by higher headquarters, and provide those resources to save lives, prevent human  suffering, or mitigate great property damage in response to a request for assistance from a civil  authority, under imminently serious conditions when time does not permit approval from a  higher authority within the United States.”"
7.10.2.1,,"AGRs may support an “Immediate Response” situation. Contingency situations  of an emergency nature, where AGR Airmen are employed under the immediate response  doctrine, shall be reported to the Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) as soon as  practicable to permit reassessment of whether there remains a necessity to employ them  under that authority.

8.4,,Voluntary Tour Curtailment.  Normally AGR members must serve 24 months of their  current assignment and complete their applicable service commitments before early release is  approved.
8.4.1,,"AGR members may request early release from their AGR tour based on personal  hardship or other valid reason. They must submit a fully justified curtailment request through  their chain of command (including the HRO) to TAG or CG, who is the final  approval/disapproval authority. This authority may be delegated to the HRO."
8.4.2,,"Airmen who voluntarily request separation from AGR status are not entitled to  separation pay (10 USC § 1174, DoD FMR and JTR). This includes Airmen who voluntarily  accept a military technician position."
8.4.3,,"Due to end-strength accounting considerations, any voluntary curtailment requests  submitted between 1 July and 30 September with a requested date of separation (DOS) prior  to 31 October can only be approved by TAG, CG, or delegated authority for Title 32 AGR  members, or the authority/delegated authority outlined in ANGI 36-6 for Title 10 ANG  Statutory Tour members."
8.4.4,,AGR members with an approved tour curtailment application who later request  withdrawal of the curtailment action must have the approval to withdraw the curtailment from  the final command signatory for the action.
8.4.5,,"If medical care is required for any illness, injury, or disease incurred or aggravated while  on an AGR tour, the member has 180 days after his/her voluntary release to report the condition  for LOD determination consideration. When members do not report their illness, injury, or  disease, it is presumed they are (1) capable of performing their military duties, (2) they do not  require treatment, and (3) they have no unresolved health condition(s) rendering them unable  to meet retention or mobility standards in accordance with DAFMAN 48-123. Refer to DAFI  36-2910 to address previously unreported illnesses/injuries/diseases."
8.5,,"Involuntary Tour Curtailment.  Commanders considering involuntary curtailment should  use all quality-force tools available (e.g., referral OPRs/EPRs, LOCs, LORs, nonjudicial  punishment) prior to initiating an involuntary curtailment. Depending on the nature of the  involuntary curtailment, commanders may consider discharge in lieu of involuntary curtailment."
8.5.1,,"Commanders should initiate a preliminary inquiry with the HRO to determine if an  involuntary curtailment is appropriate. The commander will notify the Airman, in writing, of  the proposed action after consulting with HRO. The curtailment timeframe may vary  depending on the circumstances leading up to the curtailment decision. While every effort must  be made to provide due process to AGR members, when there is a preponderance of evidence  that indicates that the AGR member may be a threat to others, the ANG or national security,  AGR orders may be curtailed immediately.   38  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022"
8.5.1.1,,"After acknowledging receipt of commander notification, the Airman may submit  a written statement within 7 calendar days of notification. The written statement must be  submitted with the commander’s recommendation to TAG or CG. The commander’s  recommendation for involuntary curtailment must be submitted through the appropriate  chain of command, with a legal review, to the HRO.

Outstanding in-LOD conditions are resolved; or       2. He or she is either found fit for duty,  separated, or retired as a result of a DES finding.       (b) May elect to be released from  active duty before resolution of the conditions or completion of the DES process."
8.5.2.2,,"Reconsideration memorandums, along with any supporting documentation, shall  be submitted directly to HRO for staffing to TAG or CG. Airmen must notify HRO in  writing of their intent to request reconsideration an involuntary curtailment within 7  calendar days of receipt of notification memorandum.

8.5.3,,"If an Airman is involuntarily curtailed and is under a bonus contract, the bonus contract  will be terminated upon the expiration date of the AGR order established by the involuntary  curtailment. Repayment of any unearned portion of the bonus will be determined by NGB  Office of Primary Responsibility or the Defense Finance and Accounting System (DFAS) as  appropriate."
8.6,,"Involuntary Release.  Mission realignments, total force initiatives, Base Realignment and  Closure (BRAC), end-strength limitations or other force management actions may require  involuntary release of an AGR prior to the AGR tour end-date. The HRO will manage the   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  39  involuntary release process and Airmen will be notified of all actions and requirements associated  with this release. The notification will stipulate if the reduction affects AGR personnel only and  provides an effective date of the RIF in accordance with paragraph 10.5 If an AGR member is  eligible for AD Sanctuary, refer to DAFI 36-2110. AGR Airmen separated may be eligible for  separation pay based on length of service in accordance with 10 USC § 1174, the DoD FMR and  JTR.

Except for those who have entered  sanctuary under the provisions of 10 USC § 12646 or 10 USC § 12686, officers will be  separated by their MSD established by law. Any officers who have entered sanctuary, and do  not consent to being separated as addressed in DAFI 36-2110, may submit a request to have  their MSD extended to the date in which they reach their regular or non-regular retirement  eligibility. The request must be initiated by the officer, coordinated through his/her chain of  command (to include the HRO for awareness) and submitted by the MPMO to NGB/A1PP to  have the MSD updated in MilPDS to reflect either the first day of the month after the officer  reaches regular retirement eligibility (10 USC § 12686) or the date the officer reaches non- regular retirement eligibility (10 USC § 12646). See Table 5.2. of AFI 36-3203 for more  information regarding the conditions under which officers may request to be retained beyond  retirement eligibility."

9.1,,"AGR Continuation Board (ACB).  TAG or the CG determines if an ACB will convene.  While an ACB is not mandatory, it provides Wing, Group, and Unit Commanders, supervisors,  and AGR members an opportunity to participate in retention decisions affecting assigned AGR  personnel. The ACB may review and recommend selection for entry into the career program and/or  continuation beyond 20 years of TAFMS. Separation from the AGR program under this chapter is  not considered punitive in nature and will not be used where separation for cause is more  appropriate."
9.2,,Purpose.  Proper management of the AGR Program requires a constant evaluation of the  dynamics of the composition of the force. The ACB:
9.2.1,,Ensures only the most capable Airmen serve.
9.2.2,,Affords Airmen promotion and career development opportunities.
9.2.3,,"Allows for force-shaping based on force structure and the needs of the unit, state, and  ANG."

The letter may describe any matter  of record concerning the Airman believed to be important for the board to consider. Letters of  recommendation from other individuals cannot be submitted. All the information in the  Airman’s letter must be accurate, and the Airman must provide evidence to support any  questioned information if called on to do so. To be considered by the ACB, the letter must be  addressed to the ACB and received by the HRO no later than 15 days prior to the date the board  convenes."
9.7,,Conducting the ACB.
9.7.1,,All proceedings will be held in closed session. AGR Airmen being considered by the  ACB will receive fair and impartial consideration. The ACB will be free from any improper  command influence or other influence(s) that could impact the performance of the board’s  duties. Board members may not discuss or consider any outside communication or material  not otherwise contained in the material properly presented before the ACB. Board members  will not communicate with anyone outside the board membership in reference to the board  proceedings. Individuals appointed to the ACB will be administered the oath outlined in  Attachment 10. The board recorder will review all documents for completeness before the  board convenes.
9.7.2,,No Airmen will appear in person before the board.
9.7.3,,"The ACB reviews enlisted and officer AGR Airmen for entry into “career status” and/or  for continuation beyond 20 years of TAFMS. Each Airman being reviewed by the ACB will  complete the ACB Worksheet, documenting the member’s career intentions and the  recommendations from the member’s supervisor and chain of command, and the board will  review all completed ACB Worksheets. It is not the responsibility of the board to screen AGR  records to determine whether AGR Airmen have met the administrative requirements of the  AGR Program. Airmen on occasional and AGR deployment backfill tours are term-limited and  will not meet an ACB for consideration of career status.   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  45"
9.7.4,,"The ACB decisions are based on the needs of the unit, state, and ANG. The ACB will  consider: the Airman’s ACB Worksheet listing his/her desire to participate in the AGR  Program and all supervisor/commander recommendations, the ACB Profile (see Table 9.1),  and the “whole person” concept and current and future force structure. Each member’s service  history is reviewed to determine his/her ability to attain 20 years TAFMS and to determine if  the Airman’s participation in the career program is in the best interest of the ANG."
9.7.5,,"The board is provided a list of all the Airmen to be considered. They will also receive,  at a minimum, the following for each Airman:  the ACB Worksheet, relevant personnel  information as determined by the state to conduct “whole person” concept review, and any  letters submitted by the Airman to the board in accordance with paragraph 9.6.3 Documents  prepared or submitted specifically for board use will be disposed of in accordance with AFI  33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program."
9.7.6,,"The ACB will not be used to terminate the AGR orders of those Airmen who should  have been removed from the AGR Program under the provisions of paragraphs 8.5, 8.6, 8.7,  and 8.8 of this instruction."
9.8,,"ACB Post-Board Process.  The recorder will publish a report of the ACB actions and  recommendations using Attachment 11, AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Report Format, as a  guide. The report will be submitted to TAG or the CG no later than 15 days from the board  completion date. The recommendations of the ACB are not binding but will be given serious  consideration. Other than the ACB Report, and possible ACB Minority Report (Attachment 12),  no record of the ACB proceedings will be prepared."
9.8.1,,"The report captures the board’s recommended actions concerning members’ entry into  the career program, continuation beyond 20 years of TAFMS, or non-continuation on the AGR  tour. Memorandums of notification will be prepared and forwarded to each Airman and  leadership indicating the ACB decision. Normally, notifications will be provided to everyone  within 60 days following the board."
9.8.2,,"Any ACB member who disagrees with the recommendation(s) of the majority may  submit a minority report using Attachment 12, AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Minority  Report Format, as a guide. The member will sign the minority report as well as the board  proceedings and will annotate on the board proceedings that a minority report is being  submitted as an attachment to the ACB Report."
9.8.3,,TAG or the CG will review the recommendations of the ACB and approve or disapprove  any or all specific recommendations. TAG or the CG is the final approval authority on all  actions and may disapprove a board in its entirety if substantial material errors and/or  procedural deficiencies are found.
9.8.3.1,,"Post-review ACB memorandums of notification will be prepared using  Attachment 13, Post-review AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Notification Memorandum  (Commander), for each commander to communicate the ACB decisions to their affected  Airmen."
9.8.3.2,,"Each Airman will be required to sign a statement to acknowledge notification of  ACB results (see Attachment 14, AGR Continuation Board (ACB) Member  Acknowledgement of Decision Notification). Notifications will typically be provided to   46  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  each individual no later than 30 days after TAG or the CG approval of the board  proceedings."
9.9,,Entry into the AGR Career Program.  The ACB may review members for entry into the  AGR Career Program. Requests and recommendations for AGR career status are reviewed and  approved by TAG or the CG.
9.9.1,,"AGR Career Status may be granted to individuals regardless of their ability to attain 20  years of TAFMS prior to their MSD or maximum age. Airmen granted career status (successive  tour) shall be administered with the understanding that their service may lead to a military  retirement after attaining the required years of TAFMS. However, career status does not  guarantee continuation to 20 years of TAFMS and a regular retirement. Continuation to 20  years of TAFMS and beyond is contingent upon individual performance, career progression,  mission requirements, force management, and the needs of the unit, state, and ANG."
9.9.2,,Reassignment to a new follow-on AGR position that exceeds the initial probationary  tour should result in an extension to the probationary period in accordance with paragraph
6.2.1,,of this instruction.
9.9.3,,AGR members approved for entry into the AGR career program who subsequently  separate from the AGR program forfeit their career status. Officer and enlisted Airmen who  return to the AGR program will serve a new probationary period and be reconsidered for entry  into the career program in accordance with this instruction.
9.10,,"Continuation Beyond 20 Years of Active Federal Military Service.  A follow-on tour for  an Airman who has attained 20 years or more of TAFMS is primarily dependent upon the needs  of the unit, state, and ANG."
9.10.1,,Approved extensions will normally be one to two years in length. Airmen would then  be required to meet another ACB at the end of the approved extension period.
9.10.2,,Any extension beyond two years should be justified to include time in grade  considerations in accordance with AFI 36-3203.
9.11,,Non-continuation on an AGR Tour.  Airmen not selected for entry into the career program  or continuation beyond 20 years of TAFMS will be provided at least 180 days notification prior to  the expiration of their AGR order.
9.11.1,,Airmen not selected for entry into the AGR career program or for continuation after  achieving 20 years active service will be released from active duty on the expiration of their  AGR orders.
9.11.2,,"Airmen not continued by an ACB are still eligible to apply for and accept a new AGR  assignment if they are reenlistment eligible (enlisted) and are not restricted by MSD, age, or  another mandatory separation reason. If selected for a new AGR assignment, the Airman’s  date of separation will be adjusted so he/she can accept the assignment."
9.12,,ACB Reconsideration Process.  The final reconsideration authority for the ACB decision  is TAG or the CG. AGR members may request reconsideration of an ACB decision by forwarding  their request with supporting documentation to the HRO for staffing. Reconsiderations must arrive  to the HRO no later than 30 days from the date on the ACB decision memorandum.   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  47
9.12.1,,Supporting justification not provided with the original ACB Worksheet may be  included in the reconsideration request. The request must be reviewed and endorsed in a timely  manner by each level of command prior to reaching the HRO for processing. Endorsements  must include rationale behind the support or non-support of the individual’s request.
9.12.2,,Reconsideration requests received without the appropriate chain of command  coordination will be returned to the Airman without action. Reconsiderations must be received  by the HRO no later than 30 days from the date on the ACB decision memorandum. The  Airman’s chain of command will not hold a reconsideration request to circumvent the 30-day  submission requirement.
9.12.3,,The reconsideration decision of TAG or the CG is final. There is no option for  additional reconsideration beyond TAG or the CG.
9.13,,Out-of-Cycle ACB.  An out-of-cycle ACB may be requested by Airmen or their leadership  chain if a retention decision is required outside the normal ACB process. An out-of-cycle ACB  shall not be used in lieu of an involuntary curtailment.
9.13.1,,Processing Procedures. An out-of-cycle ACB request should be forwarded to the HRO  for staffing. The HRO will staff the request to TAG or the CG for decision.
9.13.2,,"A notification memorandum will be prepared and forwarded to the Airman and  leadership indicating the out-of-cycle ACB decision. If career status is denied, the normal  reconsideration and notification process will apply.  Table 9.1.  ACB Profile.

10.1,,"Priority Placement of Overgrade Airmen.  The Priority Placement Program (PPP) is  designed for the management of overgrade AGR Airmen. Reductions in Force (RIF) actions take  precedence over the PPP. Because of unique mission requirements and unit force management  plans, each HRO must develop written PPP procedures that incorporate the following:"
10.1.1,,Ensure the fewest number of personnel are administratively reduced in grade or  released from AGR status.
10.1.2,,Ensure AGR personnel in an overgrade status and military technicians in a retained  grade status will be given simultaneous PPP consideration. Neither category has priority over  the other.
10.1.3,,Placement must be based on the least amount of impact to the individual and mission.
10.2,,Implementation of PPP.
10.2.1,,AGR personnel who become overgrade to their UMD assignment will be entered into  the PPP as described below:
10.2.1.1,,"Airmen will be entered into the PPP on the same date as the action causing them  to become an overgrade. The overgrade condition should be resolved as soon as possible  but can remain for a maximum of 24 months. If an extension to the overgrade condition is  required, it must be approved by NGB/A1PP in accordance with DAFI 36-2110."
10.2.1.2,,The HRO will notify AGR members in writing when they have been placed in  the PPP and when they are 180 calendar days away from the expiration of their PPP  placement. The FSS will also be given informational copies.
10.2.2,,"An Airman in the PPP will be offered, in writing, the first full-time AGR position  available on the UMD within the state for which the Airman is fully qualified for assignment  as outlined in Chapter 6."
10.2.2.1,,"The written offer will identify the position, unit of assignment, and unit location."
10.2.2.2,,The position offered should be in a unit within the locally established  commuting-distance of the Airman's residence. This does not preclude entitlement to PCS  if the position requires reassignment to another installation.
10.2.3,,"Overgrade AGR Airmen must accept or decline a position offered under the PPP  within 10 workdays of the date of receipt of the written offer. If the Airman accepts the  position, the HRO will direct the FSS to reassign the Airman within 30 days of acceptance of  the position."
10.2.4,,An enlisted AGR in overgrade who declines a position offered under the PPP must be  reduced in grade to the maximum grade of the UMD position no later than 30 workdays after  the declination in accordance with AFI 36-2502. Officers will be separated from AGR status  if they decline a position offered under the PPP. Note: officers in sanctuary must be retained  until they meet eligibility for a regular retirement in accordance with 10 USC § 12686. (T-0).   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  49
10.2.5,,TAG or the CG may approve the retention of an Airman in the PPP after the individual  has declined an offered position if the declination was based on justifiable circumstances which  would have created a severe hardship for the Airman.
10.3,,"Notification of Overgrade.  HROs or designated representatives must counsel AGR  personnel on the provisions of this chapter and DAFI 36-2110, within 30 days of the date they are  assigned as an overgrade."
10.4,,Reduction in Force.  RIFs are designed to manage AGR Airmen who become excess to the  state’s AGR RAs.
10.4.1,,"The HRO administers and manages placement programs for AGR members in the  event of force reductions, requirements, and/or mission changes."
10.4.2,,Officers and enlisted serving on AGR tours may be involuntarily separated due to a  reduction in AGR RAs.
10.4.3,,Placement based on RIF actions takes precedence over placement due to PPP actions.
10.4.4,,AGR Airmen in sanctuary are exempt from RIF actions.

12.3.5.1,,AGR Airmen are expected to meet mobilization and deployment standards in  accordance with DoDI 1205.18. AGR Airmen do not have rights to remain in AGR status   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  55  to attain or maximize longevity benefits if the Airman does not remain qualified for  continued military service in accordance with DAFMAN 48-123.

Orders will be published extending the tour  until the outstanding in-LOD condition has been resolved, or the member is found fit for duty,  separated, or retired as a result of the DES finding. If the Airman is subsequently found to be  medically disqualified for continued military service, the individual will be separated or  discharged in accordance with AFI 36-3212. AGR members are not authorized INCAP pay,  pre-MEDCON, or MEDCON orders.   56  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  Chapter 13  RESOURCES, ACCOUNTING, CONTROLLED GRADES, OCCASIONAL, AND AGR  DEPLOYMENT-BACKFILL TOURS"
13.1,,"Use of AGR Resources.  All AGR members (career, probationary, occasional, and  backfills) must be assigned to validated UMD positions compatible with their military grade and  AFSC/SDI. AGR overgrades are not permitted and excesses are not authorized without prior  approval from NGB/A1."
13.1.1,,New Roles and Missions. The appropriate hiring authority may take advance- recruiting actions only when coordinated with the HRO (for Title 32 AGRs) or NGB/HR (for  Title 10 Statutory Tour AGRs) and authorized by NGB/A1M.
13.1.2,,"New accessions or promotions will not be authorized prior to new positions being  funded, validated, and effective on the appropriate UMD unless authorized by NGB/A1."
13.2,,"Accountability and Funding.  NGB/A1M is responsible for funded authorizations, control  of AGR manpower resources and controlled grades, and budgetary instruction/direction to Title  10 ANG Statutory Tour, and each state AGR."
13.2.1,,"The number of funded AGRs assigned cannot exceed the Congressional end-strength  ceiling as of 30 September of each fiscal year. Additionally, grade authorization ceilings are  established in each fiscal year by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)."
13.2.1.1,,"Due to the Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD) accounting rules, personnel  on permanent, occasional, and AGR deployment-backfill tours count toward overall ANG  AGR end-strength, and controlled grade ceilings while in AGR status. This includes NGB  (Title 10 ANG Statutory Tour AGRs) and state (Title 32 AGRs). ANG manpower and  personnel execution is reported to OSD at the end of every month and recorded as part of  the Reserve Component. The final ANG position for any fiscal year is recorded as of the  30th of September."
13.2.1.2,,Manpower RAs and controlled grade ceilings will not be exceeded without prior  written approval from NGB/A1M.
13.2.2,,"All AGR personnel must be accounted for in ANG end-strength and military personnel  reporting systems. The Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) is not the system  utilized for reporting official AGR assigned strength. AGR personnel must be coded within  the current Personnel Data System according to Attachment 4 of this instruction and Air  National Guard MilPDS User Guide – Employments, Volume 2c. Official AGR assigned  strength numbers are derived from a data extract from the MilPDS."
13.3,,"Controlled Grade Ceilings.  AGRs are managed within the congressionally mandated end- strength authorizations for Senior Master Sergeant, Chief Master Sergeant, Major, Lieutenant  Colonel, and Colonel in accordance with 10 USC § 12011 (officers) and 10 USC § 12012  (enlisted). These ceilings are approved upon the signature of the NDAA. Assignment or promotion  to these controlled grades cannot exceed the annually established military duty end-strength or  grade ceilings."
13.3.1,,NGB/A1M is responsible for allocating controlled grades to NGB and all states.   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  57
13.3.2,,NGB and states must adhere to their controlled grade limits as established by  NGB/A1M. The controlled grade ceilings by grade are the maximum available on any given  day.
13.3.3,,"All restorations, promotions, new hires, occasional, and AGR deployment-backfill  personnel (not on MPA Man-day program) must be accommodated within the controlled grade  ceiling on any given day to adhere to approved OSD end-strength accounting rules."
13.4,,Occasional Tours and AGR Deployment Backfills.
13.4.1,,"Occasional Tours. One Time Occasional Tours (OTOT) are for exceptional  circumstances only; per DoDI 1205.18, the AGR program is administered as a career program.  The OTOT tours are limited to a minimum of 31 consecutive days and up to three years in  duration. OTOT requests exceeding three years in duration must be approved in advance by  NGB/A1PP. The purpose of the OTOT program is to offer members force development  opportunities (e.g., moving from wing to JFHQ) or to fill key positions such as the State  Command Chief. This program is not utilized to work around the probationary period or  granting of career status. Normal occasional tours against valid vacancies should remain at 179  days or less. Occasional AGR tours, regardless of length, may be involuntarily curtailed by the  chain of command and do not require the affected member to be afforded the same entitlement  to reconsideration of curtailment as a permanent AGR member as prescribed in paragraph"
8.5.2,,of this instruction.
13.4.1.1,,OTOTs count against state AGR end-strength and controlled grade ceilings. All  members must meet the AGR accession requirements (Chap 5 of this instruction).  Consecutive OTOTs are not authorized. A 31-day break must occur between consecutive  OTOTs.
13.4.1.2,,Orders are processed Occasional Tour order-type in AROWS. Members must  complete and sign a Memorandum of Agreement upon accepting the OTOT and prior to  the state processing the member’s order. OTOT orders cannot take the member into AD  sanctuary or qualify the member for separation pay; any deviation requires an exception to  policy from NGB/A1PP.
13.4.1.3,,"Members serving on an OTOT remain eligible to apply and compete for career  AGR positions. If selected for a career AGR position, the state will process an amendment  to end the OTOT orders and process the Initial Probationary Order. Time served on the  OTOT does not count towards the probationary period."
13.4.1.4,,There is no authority to unilaterally establish new workload requirements for  AGRs. Operational Readiness Inspection/Unit Compliance Inspection (ORI/UCI)  preparation is considered organic workload to existing documented full-time requirements  on the UMD and not additional or temporary workload.
13.4.1.5,,"The normal occasional tour length is 179 days, with a maximum time frame not  to exceed 36 months. Airmen should have at least a 31-day break in AGR service to be put  on a second occasional AGR tour. All occasional tours are accommodated within the state’s  current RA. Occasional tours will not require a manpower change request (MCR) action."
13.4.1.6,,"AGR occasional tour personnel must be managed within the state’s RA and  controlled grade ceiling on any given day to adhere to approved OSD end-strength   58  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  accounting rules. For example, an officer resource cannot be used to hire an enlisted person  and vice versa."
13.4.2,,"AGR Deployment Backfills. AGR members activated under Title 10 and deployed for  31 days or more may be backfilled (in-kind: AFSC, grade, and AGR category)."
13.4.2.1,,"If the position cannot be backfilled by an individual with the required AFSC and  grade, the HRO has the authority to approve a backfill with a different AFSC than what is  identified for the duty position, not to exceed the deployed AGR member’s authorized  grade on the UMD. Airmen with a reporting identifier PAFSC of 92XXX and 9TXXX are  not authorized to perform AGR deployment-backfill tours."
13.4.2.2,,"The backfill is authorized only for the specific period of the incumbent’s  deployment. This includes pre-deployment out-processing, the duration of the deployment,  reconstitution time, and leave earned while deployed. If a deployed AGR member opts not  to take leave immediately following his/her return from reconstitution time, the  deployment backfill must be curtailed. Copies of the M4S e49 authorization must be  provided to the HRO to determine the backfill-inclusive dates."
13.4.2.3,,"AGR authorizations, which are not backfilled, regardless of the amount of time,  are not “bankable” for future use."
13.4.2.4,,"Due to OSD accounting rules, personnel on AGR occasional tour or backfill  orders (not MPA Man-day program) count against the state AGR strength and controlled  grade ceilings (if applicable) while in AGR status."
13.4.2.5,,"All backfills must be coded in MilPDS with a TECH-ID code of ""3"" indicating  an AGR status. The correct active duty status code (ACDU) should be a ""U"" (Temp Tour  Other) with the approved start and stop dates of the AGR orders, place ordered to active  duty, and Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD)."
13.5,,"Counter Drug Support.  By law, Airmen performing support to Counter Drug cannot be  Title 32 AGR members under 32 USC § 502(f). (T-0).

For the purpose of this instruction, the term  AGR refers to either AGR Airmen of the ANG in Full-Time National Guard Duty (FTNGD) under  32 USC § 502(f) for 180 days or more and Airmen serving on an ANG Statutory Tour under 10  USC § 12310. See 10 USC § 101(d)(6) for the legal definition.  AGR Continuation Board (ACB)—a process which provides commanders, supervisors, and  individual AGR members an opportunity to participate in retention decisions affecting assigned  AGR personnel.  AD Sanctuary—Member has completed at least 18 but less than 20 years of total active federal  military service.  AGR Deployment Backfill—An occasional AGR member who backfills a permanent AGR  member who is activated under Title 10 authority and deployed away from home station for 31  days in support of contingency operations/AEF. These backfills should hold a compatible AFSC  for the intent to backfill the permanent AGR member’s home station duties. The backfill is  authorized for the specific period of the permanent AGR member’s deployment as indicated on  the tour duration dates on an M4S e49 and validated on the ANG Form 1299.  Career Status—AGR members obtain career status by one of the following means: (1) completing  6 continuous years as an AGR in accordance with DoDI 1205.18, (2) meeting an ACB and granted  career status by the board, (3) AGRs without career status who complete their initial probationary  tour and are extended on a successive tour, or (4) AGRs without career status who are  competitively selected for a second assignment that provides them with new orders beyond their  initial probationary tour.   ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  67  Controlled Grade Ceilings—Congressionally mandated end-strength authorizations for Senior  Master Sergeant, Chief Master Sergeant, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel in accordance  with 10 USC § 12011 (officers) and 10 USC § 12012 (enlisted).

Full-Time National Guard Duty (FTNGD)—Tours of duty performed by AGR Airmen under  32 USC § 502(f). FTNGD is not the same as Title 10 active duty; however, the terms are used  interchangeably for the purpose of some benefits and entitlements.  Involuntary Curtailment—Termination of an AGR tour for cause. Commanders considering  involuntary curtailment must use all quality force tools available (i.e., referral OPRs/EPRs, letters  of reprimand, nonjudicial punishment, etc.) prior to initiating an involuntary curtailment.  Depending on the nature of the involuntary curtailment, commanders may consider discharge in  lieu of involuntary curtailment.  Military Technicians—Excepted Civil Service employees who are Airmen of the ANG unit hired  pursuant to 32 USC § 709.  Occasional Tour—An AGR tour which supports a full-time requirement on the UMD that does  not require competition provided the selectee meets all AGR program accession and military  position requirements. The maximum tour length is 179 days. Airmen must have at least a 31-day  break in AGR service to be put on a second occasional AGR tour. All occasional tours are  accommodated within the State’s current RA. Occasional tours will not require a MCR action. A  permanent AGR resource will not to be filled by multiple occasional tours. The intent of occasional  tours is to temporarily fill a full-time requirement short term while that requirement is being  advertised and hired.

Statutory tour members are managed by NGB in  accordance with ANGI 36-6.  Unit—Often defined in manpower and personnel data systems by a distinct Personnel Accounting  Symbol (PAS) code, units are individual, functional organizations. However, operating locations  and detachments, which hold their own PAS codes, are considered parts of a parent unit versus  being a individual unit. Note: Combat Readiness Training Centers will be defined and treated as  units.   68  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  Unit Manpower Document—A unit-specific document provided by NGB/A1M that reflects all  validated and authorized military and full-time positions (requirements) and the authorized grade.  Voluntary Curtailment—Termination of an AGR tour based on an approved request initiated by  the member for early release from his/her AGR tour based on personal hardship, retirement, or  other valid reasons.

The ACB will review any Airman with an AGR tour end date in CY (XXXX)  and either is completing their probationary tour for possible entrance into the career program  and/or for continuation beyond 20 years of total active federal military service. The review  will determine continuation within the AGR Program.    Your AGR Continuation Board Worksheet has been provided to your commander for  completion. This is an opportunity for you and your supervisor to discuss career goals and  objectives to ensure you understand their expectations, as well as understand your possible  future in the AGR Program. You will be required to acknowledge you were briefed on your  supervisor’s recommendation. If you do not concur with the recommendation, you may submit  a letter to ACB. Your letter may describe any matter of record concerning you that is believed  to be important for the ACB’s consideration. You cannot submit letters of recommendation  from other individuals. All the information in the letter must be accurate and if called on to do  so, you must provide evidence to support any questioned information. To be considered by the  ACB, the letter must be addressed to ACB and received by the Human Resource Officer  (HRO) no later than 15 days prior to the ACB. You have an affirmative obligation to carefully  and completely review the documents that will be submitted to the ACB. If you believe the  documents are inaccurate or incomplete, you must bring that purported deficiency in writing to  the attention of the HRO as soon as possible - but no later than 15 days prior to the ACB.  (TAG)(The CG) will convene the ACB, consisting of at least three voting members equal or  senior in grade to those being considered (and will include the ANG State Command Chief or  CMSgt equal or higher in TIG to any enlisted member being considered), to assist in  determining which Airmen should be continued in the AGR Program based on the needs of the  ANG. Sound personnel management of the AGR Program requires a constant evaluation of the  dynamics of the composition of the force to meet force shaping requirements.   An ACB decision to grant an extension or continuation of an AGR Airman is intended to be in  the AGR Program, not for a specific assignment. Continuation is dependent on continued  performance, career progression, needs of the unit, state, ANG, and career field requirements.  ACB results will be provided on or about (date). Please contact your HRO or AGR Manager  for questions or to receive additional assistance with this process.     78  ANGI36-101  21 APRIL 2022  Attachment 8  AGR CONTINUATION BOARD (ACB) WORKSHEET  Figure A8.1.

A copy of the signed  acknowledgement must be provided to the HRO for each Airman no later than (date).               Each individual will be contacted by the HRO, on or about (date), and provided  specific instructions.

Supporting justification, not provided with the original ACB Worksheet, may be provided.  The reconsideration request must be reviewed and endorsed in a timely manner by each level  of command to HRO for processing. Endorsements must include support or non-support of  individual’s request with additional rationale.
