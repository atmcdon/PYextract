At the time of initial PCS notification, the member must extend the maximum in accordance with DAFI 36-2606 and having extended, then have at least the required service retainability to serve the minimum prescribed DoD standard tour length (see PDTATAC AP-TL-01, https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/). (T-0) The DAF Form 899, which orders reassignment of members selected under this program, must reflect both the correct total number of months the member will serve as an extended long tour volunteer, and the fact that the member was selected as an extended tour volunteer. Example: a first term Airman or Guardian selected as an extended long tour volunteer for reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to serve a total of 48 months. Even though the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel- Regulations/Supplements/) reflects a tour length of 36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the correct entry for block 11 on the DAF Form 899 is “48” (JTR tour length of 36 plus the 12 months as an Extended Long Overseas Tour (ELT) volunteer). In addition, item 12, ELT will reflect an “X” to indicate the member volunteered for, was selected for, and will serve the ELT (assignment action reason is AO, extended tour volunteer”).

Members will not be assigned to active duty on land outside the U.S. and its territories or possessions until they have completed Air Force or Space Force basic training requirements. In time of war or national emergency declared by Congress or the President, the period of required basic training (to include specialty training immediately following basic training), or its equivalent, shall not be less than 12 weeks.

Overseas tour lengths prescribed by DoD are normally based on quality-of-life conditions with long tour locations usually comparing favorably to U.S. standards.

Also, overseas tour lengths members serve can be affected by choices members are authorized to make as outlined in paragraph 7.11. Members performing duty at a permanent duty station which has a different tour length than that of their parent organization or a different tour length than the location of the manpower authorization to which assigned (see paragraph 1.2 and 3.4 for additional guidance), will serve the tour length applicable to their permanent duty station. (T-1) In accordance with DoDI 1315.18 the standard tour length for members stationed OCONUS is 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied (except for Alaska and Hawaii), unless the Air Force or Space Force provides conclusive evidence to the DoD that tours at specific locations should be shorter because of the lack of support facilities.	The tour length (for assignment planning purposes) is 36 months accompanied	and	24		months	unaccompanied		if	the	PDTATAC	AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/) does not specify a tour length for a location. Accompanied by dependent tours and command sponsorship of dependents are permitted only when government family quarters or government approved family quarters and support facilities are available to the member. When a tour length of less than 36/24 is requested, before selection of members for PCS, the Assignment OPR must obtain tour length approval from DoD according to paragraph 7.2.1 below, or by SecAF when the guidance in paragraph 7.2.3 applies.

This voluntary program affords enlisted members special assignment selection consideration ahead of volunteers for the DoD prescribed overseas tour length according to the priorities shown in Table 6.3. Example: an enlisted member with dependents who volunteers and is selected as an extended long tour volunteer for a location with a 36-month accompanied and 24-month unaccompanied tour length would be required to serve 48 months accompanied or 36 months unaccompanied.
