Table 4.2 establishes a minimum time-on-station for selection for TDY (as  prescribed in this chapter), after PCS and before PCS and before separation (including  retirement).  Normally, members who have recently completed a PCS and those pending  PCS or separation/retirement should not be sent TDY or permitted to remain on TDY,  when the departure date or completion date is less than the minimums shown in Table 4.2.   It is recognized that the minimums in Table 4.2 may not be adequate in all circumstances  for all members.  However, generally the minimums established provide enough time for  most members and most base agencies to take care of essential processing or other  requirements.  In some instances, essential processing or other actions may need to be  completed via a power of attorney, by mail or message, or rescheduled on a priority basis  due to member\u2019s absence on TDY.  Authority to waive the established time-on-station  minimums is delegated to the unit commander provided waiver does not interfere with the  member meeting the RNLTD for a projected PCS, or separation/retirement on the  scheduled date.  Members should be given the opportunity to state if a hardship would be  created as a result of a waiver and commanders should confirm that all required PCS,  separation or retirement actions can be accomplished.  Example:  a member who has no  dependents and resides on-base in unaccompanied housing may not require 30 days on  station immediately preceding separation; or, a member scheduled to take 30 days leave in  conjunction with PCS may agree to reduce the number of days leave in order to remain on   84  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  TDY for an additional period of time negating the requirement for TDY replacement; or,  if  necessary, a commander may disapprove delay enroute in conjunction with a member\u2019s  PCS in order to complete the TDY and still comply with the RNLTD for a projected PCS.",

Notes:  1. If upon being advised of the requirement for training in conjunction with a PCS, a member  alleges attendance creates a personal hardship, the MPF will immediately advise the gaining  MAJCOM or FLDCOM of the specifics of the hardship with an information copy to the  assignment OPR. (T-1) The gaining MAJCOM or FLDCOM evaluates the circumstances and  direct action with information copy to the assignment OPR, or request action by the  assignment OPR, as appropriate.  2. For courses of 20 weeks or more, members will attend in PCS status. (T-1) Exception:   members graduating from basic training who are assigned directly to technical school are  assigned in PCS status, regardless of the course length.  3. Additional restrictions to travel mode are:   a. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the new base after PCS if assigning the member  overseas.   b. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the current overseas base before PCS for those  returning from overseas to a CONUS assignment.   c. Do not direct TDY enroute PCS when the member has a continuous overseas tour within the  same theater and training in the CONUS.  d. Direct TDY enroute PCS when a member has a continuous overseas tour to a different  overseas theater and training in the CONUS.  e. Do not direct TDY enroute PCS for members whose TDY location is within commuting  distance of either their losing or gaining base.   4. When more than one TDY option exists the assignment OPR or MPF computes the options  and directs the least costly option.  There are times when the directed travel mode may cause a  member a personal, financial, or dependent hardship.  If the member requests deviation from  the least expensive mode based on hardship, they will submit a request substantiating the   90  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  R  U  L  E  A  B  C  If the member is  And will  Then attendance is (see notes 1 through 5)  details of hardship to the TDY funding authority (example:  Air Education and Training  Command Financial Management and Comptroller (AETC/FM) for AETC related courses) for  final approval/disapproval. (T-2) Do not approve deviations solely for personal convenience.  5. For members performing TDY enroute, the PCS also begins upon departure from their  current station, therefore, members must meet all PCS eligibility requirements, (example:   time-on-station, second PCS in same FY, etc.) as of their departure date unless the appropriate  authority approves the required waiver (see paragraph 6.31). (T-1) Determine if minimum  time-on-station is met per paragraph 6.5 and the FY for dislocation allowance (see  paragraph 6.44) based on the date the member departs on PCS.  6. When assigning members overseas who attend a course or courses in TDY enroute status do  not include in special orders that the member is to depart the training location the day after  graduation from the last course.  The number of days of leave a member desires (if any)  between course graduation and their port reporting date is managed by controlling the  departure date from the last training location.  Travel arrangements and the member\u2019s arrival  at the port must be in compliance with their port reporting instructions. (T-1) Members who  arrive at the port earlier than their directed reporting instructions will be charged with leave  and could incur additional expenses while waiting for their scheduled transportation. (T-1)   7. The FSS will include in the special orders a \"report not earlier than date (RNETD)\" for each  scheduled course. (T-1) The RNETDs are one day prior to the announced class start dates.   Also, special orders should contain remarks directing the member to depart no later than one  day after the respective course\u2019s graduation date.  The number of days leave a member desires  (if any) between a course graduation and the start of a second or subsequent course is the  difference between the authorized travel time and subsequent course RNETD.  Example:  if  the member is traveling via commercial air, then the authorized travel time is one day.   Therefore, if the first course graduates on the 1st of February and the subsequent course starts  on the 15th of February, the member is charged 11 days leave.  The 2nd of February is the  mandatory travel day, leave begins on the 3rd of February and continues through the 13th of  February, and leave stops when the member arrives on the next RNETD (14 February\u2014one  day prior to the subsequent course start date).  8. Officers selected to attend missile training with subsequent assignment to a missile unit will  proceed directly from Air Education Training Center training to operation readiness training,  then to unit of assignment using authorized travel time only. (T-1) The member must take  leave enroute, if desired, before entry into Air Education Training Center training. (T-1)   9. If satisfactory completion of training is a prerequisite for the next assignment, then the  member is not permitted to make the PCS to the new duty station first and then attend training  via TDY and return to the new base.

Severe problems can occur if a member\u2019s date of separation expires while TDY.  Commanders  may waive date of separation/PCS (Columns D and E) selection minimums; however, review all  other options before committing assigned members to a TDY who are PCSing, retiring, or  separating.  When waiving minimums, the TDY completion date cannot interfere with out- processing or departure date for PCS, retirement, or separation.

Regardless of the tour length of the  overseas location, concurrent travel must have been granted so the mother and child could  travel overseas together. (T-1) The 12-month post-delivery deferment is not authorized if  approval has been granted for the mother and child to travel overseas concurrently.  The 12- month deferment period also applies to any TDY.  For the purpose of a TDY, a service member  may request to waive the 12-month deferment period by each TDY occurrence.  See  paragraph 4.6.7 for additional guidance on TDY deferments.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  125",

A service member may request consideration not to be enroute  PCS during the 12-week closed period during which the member’s civilian spouse is expected to  give childbirth.

This provision applies only when the spouse is relocating as a result of PCS and the  service member’s movement at an alternate time is compatible with Air Force or Space Force  requirements.  The intent, to the degree practical, is to enable the service member to accompany  the spouse and relocate the spouse at a time of less difficulty, hardship, or risk.  It is not intended  to ensure the member’s presence at the time of birth.  Sometimes it may be necessary for a service  member to be enroute PCS during this 12-week closed period, for example, when PCS involves  TDY enroute for training which cannot be rescheduled.  When a service member’s presence is  medically essential during birth, the service member may request consideration for humanitarian  deferment as outlined in Attachment 15.  A request not to be enroute PCS during the 12-week  closed period must be submitted by the member, in writing, to the assignment OPR through the  MPF within 7 calendar days after official assignment notification, or immediately after the date a  service member’s spouse is diagnosed as pregnant. (T-1) Include in the request the action the  service member desires and state where the spouse plans on moving from and to.  Attach a  statement from the attending physician indicating the expected delivery date.  Service members  receive consideration for change of PCS as follows:  First, the service member serving overseas  and accompanied by their spouse (regardless of command sponsorship status) may request  consideration of a voluntary extension of overseas tour as outlined in paragraph 7.5.  Second, a  service member may request a curtailment when the attending physician recommends curtailment,  in writing, based on medical reasons (see Table 7.8.).

A surplus exists when there are members assigned to a location  that has zero manpower authorizations in grade and AFSC/SFSC for officers, or in a career  field ladder for enlisted; (in most cases, for enlisted manning purposes, a career field ladder  includes manpower authorizations in grades AB through SMSgt in an AFS.

    "header": "2. Certain assignments require service retainability greater than the minimum.  When applicable,  assignment OPRs state the retainability required in assignment remarks, additional assignment  instructions, or a PPC.  3. When the member is ineligible to obtain 12 months retainability (example:  an officer has an  established date of separation or retirement date, an members is HYT restricted, or is ineligible due to  quality control or some other reason) or declines to obtain the retainability (example:  an enlisted member  signs a DAF Form 964, or an officer elects to 7-day opt), the DEROS is extended to equal the date of  separation/retirement date.  Normally this involuntary overseas tour extension is accomplished  automatically by the PDS.   4. When a member is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retainability (see note 3 above) and has  less than 7 months from DEROS to date of separation/retirement date, the DEROS is extended to equal  date of separation/retirement date.  When a member, who is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months  retainability, has at least 7 months from DEROS to date of separation, assignment OPRs provide an  assignment (as an exception to the requirement that members have 12 months service retainability).  5. A member eligible to obtain 12 months retainability must do so. (T-1) Members may not extend or  agree to obligated service just long enough to qualify for the 7-month retainability exception in note 4.   Example:  An officer with an indefinite date of separation will incur a 12-month ADSC upon PCS.  The  member may not agree to incur only a 7-month PCS ADSC.  An enlisted member eligible to extend to  meet the full 12-month retainability requirement will do so.  The member cannot extend just enough to be  eligible for the 7-month exception.  6. A member who cannot obtain the full 12 months retainability but can obtain at least 7 (or more) months  retainability, must obtain the maximum retainability for which the member is eligible before they can  receive an assignment under the 7 month retainability exception. (T-1) Example:  An enlisted member  with 5 months service retainability from DEROS to date of separation who is eligible to extend for only  an additional 5 months (their maximum allowable), must extend the full 5 months (total 10 months  retainability), or decline in writing.  The enlisted member will not be permitted to extend just 2 months to  be eligible for PCS under the 7-month retainability exception.   7. Minimum retainability requirement is 6 months.  However, the expectation that members obtain  maximum authorized per HYT up to 24 months retainability, if otherwise eligible, remains.  If due to  short notice assignment, and retainability cannot be obtained at losing location, the members will be  required to obtain retainability at gaining location within 30 days from date arrived station.  There is no  minimum retainability required for members being reassigned as a patient or prisoner.    200  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 6.5.  Enlisted Member Retainability Suspense Delay.  R  U  L  E  A  B  If an enlisted member requests a delay  in obtaining retainability and the  reason is:  Then, the MPF Chief or designated authority may grant  an extension of suspense to (see note 1, note 2 and note  3):   1  To reduce obligated service which would  be deducted from a Selective  Reenlistment Bonus  Not later than the 25th day of the 7th month before DEROS  for enlisted member assigned overseas who will not serve  an in-place consecutive overseas tour, or not later than 15  calendar days before enlisted member departs on PCS or  enters an in-place consecutive overseas tour, or the last day  of selective reenlistment bonus eligibility, whichever is  earlier (see note 4).  2  For quality control reasons (see note 5)  Not later than 15 calendar days after the enlisted member  becomes eligible for PCS but not later than 60 days prior to  the projected departure date, or the effective date of an in- place consecutive overseas tour, whichever is earlier.     3  For a first-term Airman or Guardian with  CAREERS retraining  The date of award of the 3-skill level (see note 6).  4  The enlisted member is on TDY or leave  Not later than 15 calendar days after return to their  permanent duty station (for TDY of more than 60 days,  forward documents and require the member to obtain  retainability at the TDY location).  5  For an extended long overseas tour (first- term Airman and Guardian only)  Allow retainability for a portion of the extended tour (only)  to be obtained after arrival overseas (see note 7).  6  Sell leave in conjunction with  reenlistment (career enlisted Airmen and  Guardians only)     90 days before ETS but not later than 120 calendar days  before RNLTD or effective date of in-place consecutive  overseas tour, whichever is earlier.     7  To apply for voluntary retirement which  coincides with the member’s current  DEROS (see note 8)  Not later than the 25th day of the 7th month before current  DEROS or not later than 15 days after denial of the request,  whichever is earlier.  Note:   1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 6.28.8.  2. Do not grant a delay:   a. Beyond the date an enlisted member desires to use allowances.   b. For enlisted members permanently ineligible to obtain full retainability.   c. For circumstances not shown above (example:  members who are HYT restricted, etc.).  3. Enlisted members assigned overseas must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of  receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. (T-1) Delays to this requirement are not  considered unless rule 1 or 7 applies (see notes 4 and 8).  A delay may be granted in obtaining full consecutive  overseas tour or in-place consecutive overseas tour retainability only for one of the reasons shown in the table.  4. A delay may be granted to reduce selective reenlistment bonus impact, but it may not be possible within the  parameters authorized for delays to eliminate impact entirely.  See DAFI 36-2606 when assignment is in an  additionally awarded selective reenlistment bonus AFSC/SFSC and the enlisted member desires to reenlist in  the selective reenlistment bonus AFSC/SFSC for PCS retainability.  Example:  A member is assigned to  Randolph AFB and is selected for reassignment to Osan AB and has an approved FO assignment to Hickam  AFB.  The member has the 12 months retainability.  This amount satisfies the requirement for Osan, but he  needs 36 months retainability for Hickam.  The member has a selective reenlistment bonus.  The member can  request a delay up to 15 days before departing Randolph but must have the 36 months retainability before   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  201  R  U  L  E  A  B  If an enlisted member requests a delay  in obtaining retainability and the  reason is:  Then, the MPF Chief or designated authority may grant  an extension of suspense to (see note 1, note 2 and note  3):   departing or the FO will be canceled.    5. A delay for quality control reasons can only be granted if the enlisted member already had an assignment  prior to the quality control conditions.  6. Enlisted members assigned overseas must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of  receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. (T-1) Delays to this requirement are not  considered.  Enlisted members must extend their enlistment the maximum in accordance with DAFI 36-2606  if they either cannot reenlist in their present AFSC/SFSC or desire to reenlist in their retraining AFSC/SFSC  (which is a selective reenlistment bonus skill). (T-1) For reenlistment at an enroute TDY training site, the  losing unit commander must obtain concurrence of the TDY unit commander to reenlist the enlisted member  at the training site (last training site when there are more than one). (T-1) Do not permit departure from the  last training site without the full prescribed PCS retainability.  If an enlisted member does not reenlist upon  completion of a training course, hold the enlisted member at the training site and notify the assignment OPR  responsible for the training into AFSC/SFSC, AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO, and the losing MPF within 3  calendar days after course completion and provide a report of the circumstances.  Disposition instructions are  provided by the assignment OPR within 5 calendar days.  7. Grant first-term Airman or Guardian ineligible to reenlist because of insufficient time in service to request a  Career Job Reservation (CJR), a delay to obtain retainability for a portion of the Extended Long Overseas  Tour length.  At the time of initial PCS notification, the member must extend the maximum in accordance  with DAFI 36-2606 and having extended, then have at least the required service retainability to serve the  minimum prescribed DoD standard tour length (see PDTATAC AP-TL-01, https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/). (T-0) The DAF Form 899, which orders reassignment of  members selected under this program, must reflect both the correct total number of months the member will  serve as an extended long tour volunteer, and the fact that the member was selected as an extended tour  volunteer.  Example:  a first term Airman or Guardian selected as an extended long tour volunteer for  reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to serve a total of 48  months.  Even though the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel- Regulations/Supplements/) reflects a tour length of 36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the  correct entry for block 11 on the DAF Form 899 is “48” (JTR tour length of 36 plus the 12 months as an  Extended Long Overseas Tour (ELT) volunteer).  In addition, item 12, ELT will reflect an “X” to indicate the  member volunteered for, was selected for, and will serve the ELT (assignment action reason is AO, extended  tour volunteer”).  Also include the following statement in item 24 (Remarks) of the DAF Form 899, "Approval  granted to delay obtaining (indicate number) months service retainability for a portion of the extended  (indicate accompanied or unaccompanied) tour according to Chapter 2, paragraph 6.28."  Upon approval of the  delay, the losing MPF updates ALC "8" with an expiration date equal to the projected tour completion date for  the full prescribed tour.  The gaining MPF verifies this update upon the member's arrival and corrects as  necessary.  When the member's date of separation is updated as a result of reenlistment, the DEROS  automatically changes to reflect the full prescribed extended tour length.  This is important as the gaining MPF  uses the DAF Form 899 as the source document to award initial DEROS (standard (accompanied or  unaccompanied) tour length plus 12 months).  See DAFMAN 36-2102 and the Orders Processing Application  execution guidance in the myFSS website for further guidance in accomplishing the DAF Form 899.  8. Member’s request for voluntary retirement should be submitted within 30 days of DEROS forecast.  The  MPF does not need to report delays approved under this rule as they do not purge until the member is within 8  months of current DEROS.  Once a member has an assignment selection date any retirement request is  submitted under 7-day option rules.   202  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 6.6.

(T-1)   3. For officers, as an exception, select a volunteer if the officer provides a written statement  indicating understanding that their DEROS is involuntarily extended to match their mandatory  date of separation or mandatory retirement date.  In this case, the officer separates or retires  upon completion of the involuntarily extended overseas tour.  4. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, are ineligible for PCS selection if  upon completion of an unaccompanied short tour, they are subject to involuntary DEROS  extension due to HYT restriction.  For PCS selection, AFPC/DPM is the USAF waiver  authority and ETMO is the USSF wavier authority.  5. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether the  enlisted member has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to  be eligible for selection. (T-1) AFPC is the USAF waiver authority and ETMO is the USSF  waiver authority.  The intent of a retainability requirement beyond completion of the  unaccompanied overseas tour length is either to ensure the enlisted member can obtain the  required retainability to receive a CONUS PCS after an unaccompanied overseas tour and  preclude involuntary extension of an unaccompanied tour due to lack of PCS retainability, or  to ensure adequate retainability to allow election of an accompanied tour.  The retainability  requirement beyond tour completion is not intended to preclude an involuntary DEROS  extension due to lack of PCS retainability for enlisted members who are serving an  accompanied tour.  The accompanied tour length is not always 12 months more than the  unaccompanied tour (e.g., 24/15-month tours), so eligibility for selection uses the  accompanied tour length for 24/12 tours, OR the unaccompanied tour length plus 12 months  for 24/15 tours.  Example:  for a 24/15 tour, the accompanied tour is 9 months longer than the  unaccompanied tour, but CONUS PCS retainability required is 12 months.  Therefore, to be  eligible for selection without knowing which tour a person will elect, they must have or be  able to obtain 27 months total retainability.  6. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether the  enlisted member has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to  be eligible for selection. (T-1) AFPC/DPM is the waiver authority.   7. Consider a first-term Airman or Guardian with an approved CJR as a career enlisted  Airman or Guardian for retainability for overseas PCS selection.  8. Initial ETS is the completion of the enlisted member’s initial enlistment with no extensions.  9. AFPC/DPM must approve selection for PCS of an enlisted member when, upon completion  of an unaccompanied overseas short tour the enlisted member would have less than 7 months  PCS retainability. (T-1)   10. Members must be able to obtain retainability, regardless of marital status or whether  members have dependents, to allow members to elect the accompanied tour length or to  request command sponsorship if they acquire dependents.

Current ADSC:  18 May 2017 (more than 6 months).  CMSgt Alejandro has an ADSC beyond 6 months and has the retainability for the assignment,  therefore she is ineligible for retirement under the 7-day option program and must go on assignment.   Declination is not an option.    16. The following is an example to clarify Rule 15 when member is assigned in the CONUS, does  have full retainability, does not have an ADSC, and are not retirement eligible.  Member:  SMSgt Haines.

Note: (The mission ultimately dictates if a RNLTD adjustment or assignment cancellation is  most appropriate.  The gaining CC, losing CC, AFPC/DPM, and ETMO work closely together  to determine what action is in the best interest of the DAF and the member.)  1. Placement in an AEFI is not the same as being identified to deploy.  Tasked members are  selected and updated in the GFM authoritative data source.

Requests are forwarded to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO as an exception to policy and are  considered on a case-by-case basis.  Commander must justify why the member cannot be  replaced on deployment. (T-1) In case of short notice assignment, a later RNLTD may be  appropriate.    3. Upon CC request, AFPC/DPM or ETMO assignment OPRs will cancel the PCS regardless  of the member’s volunteer status.  4. Updating the proper duty status code (20, 21, or 25), AEFI, and accurately reporting  departure dates in the PDS, prevents the assignment system from selecting members for  overseas assignments with a RNLTD within the deployment period plus 30-days upon return.  5. The CC must request a RNLTD extension as the only option if the member was a volunteer  for the assignment. (T-1) Returning the member from deployment is not an option unless the  deployed CC, Command Chief Master Sergeant, MAJCOM/A1R or FLDCOM/S1,  AFPC/DPM or ETMO, and AFPC/DP3AM agree it is in the best interest of the DAF.         222  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 6.10.

Note:  When the PCS is overseas, the member’s port call may be earlier than the RNLTD month as determined  by the actual departure date and leave and travel time authorized.  This will preclude a requirement to request a  change to the RNLTD and member to not use more leave than desired.  Under such circumstances, reporting  overseas prior to the RNLTD month does not result in a Category 1 PCS Processing Discrepancy.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  223  Table 6.11.

Overseas tour lengths prescribed by DoD are normally based on  quality-of-life conditions with long tour locations usually comparing favorably to U.S. standards.

However, there are exceptions and most of these are shown  below or are listed by location in the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/).  Also, overseas tour lengths members  serve can be affected by choices members are authorized to make as outlined in paragraph 7.11.   Members performing duty at a permanent duty station which has a different tour length than that  of their parent organization or a different tour length than the location of the manpower  authorization to which assigned (see paragraph 1.2 and 3.4 for additional guidance), will serve the  tour length applicable to their permanent duty station. (T-1) In accordance with DoDI 1315.18 the  standard tour length for members stationed OCONUS is 36 months accompanied and 24 months  unaccompanied (except for Alaska and Hawaii), unless the Air Force or Space Force provides  conclusive evidence to the DoD that tours at specific locations should be shorter because of the  lack of support facilities.  The tour length (for assignment planning purposes) is 36 months  accompanied  and  24  months  unaccompanied  if  the  PDTATAC  AP-TL-01  (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/)  does not specify a tour length for a location.

In some instances, tour lengths are specified by DoD based  on duty to be performed or category of members rather than being based on the normal tour  length criteria which is quality of life conditions.  Also, for some assignments, DoD has  approved DAF’s request for exception to the normal prescribed tour length.  The assignment  instructions or other guidance identifies the tour length to be served in conjunction with the  assignment.  When a tour length is based on criteria other than normal quality of life criteria  (such as duty to be performed, category of members, or the tour length for members is an  exception), such tours are not prorated (also see paragraph 7.8.).  Requests for tour length  exceptions (those which are not based on quality-of-life conditions at a location, such as, for  Professional Military Education (PME), formal education, in conjunction with training, a  school, scholarship, fellowship or grant, and so on) may be submitted per paragraph 5.5 for  consideration and approval by the appropriate level.  Adequate time should be allowed to  permit the exception request to be submitted to DoD for consideration.  When it is known that  the duration of an assignment is less than the normal prescribed tour length for an overseas  location, then either a request for overseas tour length exception is requested and approved in  advance, or curtailment of the tour length prescribed for the location is requested and approved  as an exception per paragraph 5.5.  Documentation on approved overseas tour length  exceptions, including some circumstances not listed in this instruction, is maintained by  AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.",

Overseas duty begins on the date of  departure from the CONUS, for assignment purposes, unless a member has leave approved in an  overseas area.  Credit for overseas service begins on member’s date of arrival at the new overseas  station for a member with approved leave in an overseas area prior to reporting to a new overseas  duty station.  Credit for overseas service ends on the date of arrival at the CONUS port of entry  unless a member has leave approved in an overseas area after completion of an overseas tour.   When a member has leave approved in an overseas area after completion of an overseas tour, then  credit for overseas service ends upon departure from the current overseas duty station.  As  explained below, “award” of an overseas service date means to give the member a new date equal  to the completion date of the last TDY performed in a cumulative TDY period which qualifies for  award of a new date.  Example:  a member who has never served overseas has a TAFMSD and  ODSD of 10 Sep 2000.  Upon completion of an overseas TDY, that qualifies for credit of a  completed short tour per Table 7.6, on 25 Oct 2009; the member would be awarded a new ODSD  of 25 Oct 2009 and awarded short tour credit.  An “adjustment” of an overseas service date is  adding the number of days a member was in TDY status to a previously awarded date.  Example:   a member serving in the CONUS last returned from PCS overseas on 25 Sep 2003 (ODSD is 25  Sep 2003) and the member performs 5 days TDY overseas from 1 Feb 2005 through 5 Feb 2005.

Example:  a member with an RNLTD of 30 Jun 2008 who departs  the CONUS on 20 Jun 2008 to serve a 36-month tour would have a DEROS of 20 Jun 2011.   A member with an RNLTD of 10 Sep 2008 who departs the CONUS on 1 Sep 2008 to serve a  12-month tour would have a DEROS of 1 Sep 2009.  A member with an RNLTD of 10 Feb  2008 who departs the CONUS on 31 January 2008 and arrives on 1 Feb 2008 to serve a 12- month tour would have a DEROS of 1 Feb 2009 (this member should not have departed the  CONUS prior to the DEROS month according to Table 7.4 and paragraphs 6.31 and 6.32.  No  other method is used to compute the DEROS except when member is authorized to report prior  to their RNLTD month.

On arrival of a general officer or selectee at the overseas duty station,  the DEROS is established as shown in Table 7.4, or based on assignment instructions from the  assignment OPR.  AFPC does not change the DEROS of general officers (or selectees) once  initially established.  Send DEROS change requests out of system to AF/A1LG (USAF) or  SF/S1L (USSF) for approval and reentry into the PDS.  For all members, when PCS orders  show the member elected the accompanied tour, the initial DEROS is based on the  accompanied tour length, whether the member arrives with dependents.

Overseas tour proration  recognizes overseas service at one location in proportion to overseas service at another location  with a different tour length.  Proration in conjunction with PCS is a DAF policy, except DoD may  authorize or direct proration in some instances in conjunction with a change of overseas tour length  affecting members currently assigned.  When proration is authorized (and not prohibited, see  paragraph 7.2), a member’s current overseas tour (DEROS) could either be lengthened or  shortened depending on the circumstances.  Proration may be based on when reassigned PCS to  another overseas location with a different tour length before completing the full prescribed  overseas tour at the initial location; when a tour length is changed at the member’s duty station  during a member’s overseas tour; or as determined by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.  Proration  may be suspended, or an individual request disapproved when approval does not serve the best  interests of the DAF.  Enlisted members serving an OTEIP extension (AAC 77) are not eligible  for tour proration.  When a member is reassigned to an overseas location with a different tour  length than the one currently being served, or a tour length is changed and the implementation date  affects members currently assigned, then the overseas tour is not normally prorated (longer or  shorter) unless the individual assignment instructions or tour length implementation guidance  affords the member options or prohibits proration.  Example:  implementation guidance for a  change of current tour from a shorter to longer tour may contain the option for members currently  assigned to retain the current (shorter) tour or voluntarily serve the longer tour, or it may require  serving the longer tour as mandatory or may stipulate proration from the shorter to the longer tour.

Proration of DEROS  to less than 6 months remaining is not authorized when a tour length change occurs and the member  is remaining in place unless an exception is granted by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.  This  allows adequate time for all action related to PCS to occur in a timely manner.  When tour length  changes due to PCS, the member cannot be reassigned overseas if serving a tour of 18 months or  more.

An acquired dependent is one who became a dependent after the  start of a member’s current overseas tour (such as by marriage, adoption, etc.).  See the JTR,  Appendix A, for definition of acquired dependents.  This term does not include persons  dependent upon the member before the start of member’s current overseas tour.  The tour status  of members with individually sponsored dependents or acquired dependents is not  automatically changed from unaccompanied to accompanied, nor are dependents automatically  granted command sponsorship.  When a member wants command sponsorship of individually   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  263  sponsored or acquired dependents, the member must submit a request in accordance with  paragraph 7.11.2 and receive approval.

Time creditable as overseas duty for TDY begins the day of departure from the CONUS  port excluding all leave, hospitalization, and other non-mission periods (i.e., confinement,  prisoner, Absent without Leave periods).  3. Adjustment or award of the ODSD or short tour return date does not change a member's  date arrived station.

The number of days served in TDY status to qualify for award of a new ODSD/short tour  return date is not the same as a member in PCS status whose overseas tour is curtailed (see  Table 7.5).  5. The only source document to be used to validate overseas TDY is a copy of the paid travel  voucher for each TDY claimed.  6. Credit for 2 days or more TDY began on 5 Jan 95.  For TDYs prior to this date members  needed to serve a cumulative total or 90 or more days in a consecutive 3 year period to earn  an adjustment to the ODSD/short tour return date.  7. Use country code "ZT" with a tour length of number of days served for the PDS update.   8. Members who are officially categorized via DD Form 1300 receive credit for at least one  short tour, regardless of the length of time served overseas.  Additional short tour credit is  awarded in 12 month increments, and any portion thereof, at the time of release/return to U.S.  control.  9. Use AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO correspondence as the source document.  Countries  comprising the area of responsibility are: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, United Arab Emirates  (UAE), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Yemen, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the airspace  and adjacent waters of these countries.  10. For overseas tour crediting purposes, for this TDY only, begin credit with the day of  arrival in the area of responsibility and end with the day of departure from the area of  responsibility.  11. Overseas tour length is updated to 12 months provided member meets minimum award  criteria.  Those members previously awarded short tour credit under the temporary 181-day  guidelines keep their short tour credit.  Members arriving in the area of responsibility prior to  1 Jul 11 and serving at least 181 days in a hostile fire or imminent danger pay area receive  short tour credit under the previous criteria.  Those arriving in the area of responsibility on or  after 1 Jul 11 do not receive short tour credit under the 181-day guidelines.         276  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 7.7.

Notes:    1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 7.5.6.  Commanders may not disapprove a  voluntary extension request based solely on a service member’s assignment overseas for an  arbitrary maximum period of time.  However, commanders may disapprove extension requests  based on a requirement for fresh expertise or for reasons such as job stress, personal or family  hardship, lack of adequate medical or educational facilities, etc.  2. Normal voluntary DEROS extension criteria do not apply to a member’s request for change of  overseas tour status from unaccompanied to accompanied.  Approval of command sponsorship  and change of overseas tour status requires the service member to serve the accompanied tour  length.  Therefore, the DEROS change action is an adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 7.4  (not a voluntary extension action), also see paragraph 7.11.  3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks after estimated delivery date.  Establish new DEROS  as one day after TRD.  If new DEROS is 60 days or less from old DEROS, the installation  commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may approve extension.  If new DEROS  exceeds 60 days from old DEROS, forward request to the assignment OPR.  In the case of  military couples, the installation commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may approve  up to a 60 calendar day extension of tour for both service members as long as the new DEROS of  both service members is within the same month.  The commander must notify the MPF  immediately so they can make the necessary changes to DEROS and other adjusted suspense.  (T-1)    DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  277  Table 7.8.

Systematic rotation is only for the purpose of spreading the rotation dates for service  members possessing like skills over a greater period of time to ensure continuity of operation.  3. Travel restriction date is six weeks prior to Estimated Delivery Date.  Establish the RNLTD  to gaining unit as one day prior to TRD.  Compute new DEROS by subtracting a maximum of  45 days (leave and travel time) from the new RNLTD.  If new DEROS exceeds 60 days from  old DEROS, forward a curtailment request.  In the case of military couples, the installation  commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may only approve curtailment of the  pregnant service member.  Submit a request to curtail the spouse, depending on period of  curtailment.  Enlisted service members who have extension to overseas tour approved under the  OTEIP are not eligible for curtailment (except for pregnant service members at dependent- restricted locations).  These service members may extend their DEROS beyond the travel  restriction date or request early return of civilian spouse.  In accordance with AFI 44-102,  Medical Care Management, pregnant service members assigned to isolated or remote areas  without appropriate obstetrical care will have their assignment curtailed by the 24th week of  pregnancy or earlier.  If local medical personnel are not capable of managing the early  complications of pregnancy or the pregnancy is complicated, the service member’s assignment  shall be immediately curtailed.  The commander must immediately notify the MPF so they can  make the necessary changes to DEROS and other suspenses. (T-1)   4. See paragraph 7.7.  5. When manning will not support extending the military spouse with the earlier DEROS in  their AFSC/SFSC or when the military spouse was curtailed due to operational necessity such  as force closure action within the unit assigned.  This rule does not apply when a change of  DEROS was the result of a service member’s request for the change such as cancellation of all  or partial voluntary extensions of an overseas tour.  6. Request for CONUS assignment is sent via CMS to the AFPC (RegAF) or ETMO (USSF)  OPR responsible for a service member’s AFSC/SFSC (see Table 2.1) with information copy to  the Air Force Military Justice and Policy Division (JA/JAJM), JB Andrews AFB, MD. Request  includes date confinement ends and home of record.  7. See paragraph 6.45.  Curtailment as a result of surplus based on promotion permitted only  when the promotion is to the grade of SMSgt (USSF only), CMSgt, or colonel.  8. The assignment OPR may approve cancellation (provided it is not an OTEIP extension) if the  new DEROS does not place the enlisted service member in the overseas or overseas returnee  cycle (see Attachment 13 Table A13.1. allocations column) and for officers, the new DEROS  cannot result in an assignment selection date which is past (see Table 6.7, rule 3 for assignment  selection date schedule).  This does not apply to an enlisted service member serving an  extended long tour unless cancellation requested is to an extension of the ELT.  Requests  involving OTEIP extensions are submitted to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO as exceptions  according to paragraph 5.5.  9.

Other factors, to include the Guardian Ideal  principles of an individualized approach to talent management and placement based on best fit,  may be considered.  3. Each returnee is aligned within their grouping and within each grade and AFSC/SFSC, and  further grouped by number of short tours previously served (this does not include the current  tour).  Members possessing the most number of short tours receive higher priority.  When the  number of short tours is equal for two or more returnees, higher priority within each group is  given to members who voluntarily extended their tour for a period of 6 or more months in a  short tour area or 12 months in a long tour area (OTEIP extension of tour).  Higher priority is  not given when an extension was for the purpose of command sponsoring dependents (because  this is a change in tour election and not an extension).  Additionally, each month extended  beyond the 6 or 12 month minimum raises the member’s priority.  In the event of a tie within a  priority group, members are matched in the following order:  Grade (highest grade takes precedence).  Example:  a MSgt will receive higher priority over a  MSgt selectee.  Date of Rank (DOR) (earliest date takes precedence);   Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (Officers only, when applicable per note  1) (earliest date takes precedence);   Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) (earliest date takes precedence);   Date of Birth (DOB) (earliest date takes precedence);   Reverse Social Security Number (SSN) order (use all 9 digits and lowest number takes  precedence).  Example:  if the SSN is 123-45-6789 as a normal number it would be  123,456,789, and reversed it would 987,654,321.  4. CMMs are aligned into the fourth priority group after overseas returnees within each grade  and AFSC/SFSC, and further grouped by Date Arrived Station, DOR, TAFMSD, and then  DOB.  5.

Overgrade expiration dates may not exceed 2 years from date the condition began or 2 years  from current expiration date for revalidated waivers except as specified in Column E.  In the unit  program for lieutenant colonel and major where two grades overgrade conditions exist, HQ  AFRC/CD is the approval authority and will determine the expiration date.  Forward all waiver  requests through command channels to HQ AFRC/A1K or AF/REG (for colonels) for staffing to  HQ AFRC/CD for approval/disapproval.  Waivers may be processed via TMT provided all  required information is provided.  Any requirements for exception to policy must include all  required information as outlined in paragraph 9.7.4.  If there are questions concerning  processing requirements contact HQ AFRC/A1KK for further processing instructions.  Within  the IR portfolio HQ RIO/CC is the approval authority.     2. Every effort must be made to assign lieutenant colonels and majors to valid authorizations.    Line Officers:  First-time single overgrade waivers may be approved by the RSG, detached  group commander (unit program) or HQ RIO Det/CC (IR portfolio) not to exceed 2 years.  The  RSG, NAF, Wing, detached group commander or HQ RIO Det/CC may revalidate this waiver  for an additional 1 year based on critical mission needs. HQ AFRC/CD (unit program) or HQ  RIO/CC (IR portfolio) approval is required for fourth year waivers based on critical mission  needs.  All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD approval must be processed as listed in note 1.    Non-Line Officers:  Non-line officers may be initially placed in code \u201cP\u201d for 2 years if  approved by the wing commander. The wing commander may revalidate this waiver in 2-year  increments.    The appropriate central manager (HQ AFRC/HC, HQ AFRC/SG, SAF/IAS) will approve IRs.   ART Line Officers:  ART line officers who have not attained civil service retirement eligibility  for an immediate annuity, require biannual waivers approved by their wing commander until  they are placed in a non-overgrade status, or attain retirement eligibility.  Retention of an ART in  an overgrade status beyond their civil service retirement date requires an approved waiver by HQ  AFRC/CD the first year and AF/RE for subsequent years.  All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD  approval must be processed as listed in note 1.   3. Two grades overgrade.  Two grades overgrade is only authorized in accordance with  paragraph 9.7 and PDS code \u201cT\u201d applies.  Members may be initially placed in code \u201cT\u201d for 2  years if approved by the wing commander.  All reevaluations for enlisted personnel for  additional time must be approved by the appropriate commander in 2 year increments.   Additionally, any requirement to place lieutenant colonels or majors against positions causing  two grades or more overgrade condition requires HQ AFRC/CD or HQ ARPC/DPA approval.   All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD or HQ ARPC/DPA approval must be processed as listed in  note 1.   4. See paragraph 9.1.1.      DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  341  Table 9.4.  Overage Codes.

Overage code will be updated on the incumbent who is leaving the position. When used for  training mission enhancement reasons, this code is used for Unit Training Assembly induced  workload as well as units with physical exam responsibilities.     2. Commanders may utilize this overage provision to place members transitioning from AGR  (Headquarters or Unit) tours, ART positions, or the Retired Reserve.  It applies to officers  (lieutenant colonel and below) and enlisted members (SMSgt and below) and seeks to prevent the  loss of valuable personnel because of relocation.  The gaining NAF, RSG, wing, detached group  commander or HQ RIO Det/CC has approval authority.  Personnel relocating within a commuting  area or asking to change assignments within a commuting area are ineligible with the exception of  AGR and ART personnel.  During this period overages will not count towards promotion  opportunities. Overage periods are not to exceed the member\u2019s MSO or 2 years from effective date  of change of strength accountability, whichever is greater.  Additional information is located in  paragraph 9.3.     3. Once the overage code is withdrawn the member is reassigned to HQ ARPC, or retired, if  eligible.  Efficient facilities initiatives/force reduction enlisted overages do not affect promotion  opportunities for incumbent members, however, officer overages do.  Officers will be tracked as  overage code \u201c4.\u201d     4. Approval of colonel actions will be routed through AF/REG and approved by HQ AFRC/CD  (unit) or (line IRs). The appropriate central manager (HQ AFRC/HC, AF/JA, HQ AFRC/SG,   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  343  R   U   L   E   A   B   C   D   E   If Reason For  Overage Is   Use   Overage   Code   Grade   Update   Authority   Expiration Date   SAF/IAS) will approve their O-6 actions.  Rated positions may be included in this authority against  anticipated losses as long as the overage can be eliminated within a single 2-year increment.     5. This code is used during the period to attain/maintain C rating/wartime shortfall.  HQ RIO  Det/CCs who have reached their FY funded allocation may assign an individual as an overage.     6. For the IR portfolio, the code \u201c4\u201d will also be used to identify individuals that are hired when a  command has executed its FY Defense Program authorization.  This restricts these over-manning  overages to Maj/MSgt and below.  Commands who wish to pursue an exception to this grade  restriction must submit justification to HQ RIO/CC (see paragraph 9.7.9.1.3).     7. Retirees approved in an overage position will be identified as an overage code \u201cR\u201d with an  expiration date of 2 years from date of assignment.  Requests for extension of the 2-year overage  period will be reviewed and processed as an exception to policy.  Within the IR portfolio, all retirees  will be identified as an overage code \u201cR\u201d regardless of overage status and this overage condition  will not exceed a total of 4 years from original date of assignment.      344  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Chapter 10  AFR SELECTED RESERVE GENERAL OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS",

However, exceeding grade manning levels will not be used as a goal for  enlisted promotion actions. (T-1)",

Purpose.  The Base of Preference program is intended for enlisted RegAF members on  active duty in the grades of SMSgt and below, and USSF members in the grade of MSgt and below,  for those that have met the program eligibility requirements and when manning at current and  gaining location will support reassignment action.  It consists of two separate programs; the first- term Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preference program and the career Airman (or Guardian) Base  of Preference program.  The first term Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preference program is a  reenlistment incentive under the Career Airmen Reenlistment Reservation System programs (see  AFI 36-2606).  The career Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preference program provides a voluntary  assignment option to those who have met time-on-station requirements.\nA2.2.  First Term Airman  or Guardian Program.\nA2.2.1.  General Information.  First term Airmen or Guardian may request CONUS to CONUS  PCS Base of Preference; or overseas to CONUS PCS Base of Preference; or an In-Place Base  of Preference to remain at their current CONUS location in conjunction with reenlistment and  retraining (see AFMAN 36-2100).  First term Airmen or Guardian in the CONUS may apply  for a CONUS to CONUS Base of Preference and an In-Place Base of Preference at the same  time.  CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, or in-place Base of Preference at overseas  locations are not authorized since these assignments are made in accordance with EQUAL or  GAT overseas and overseas returnee cycles and during the DEROS Forecast cycle.   Preferences are considered in the exact order listed.  Manning at current location is not a factor;  however manning at requested location must remain below the CONUS average upon arrival.\nA2.2.2.  Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions.  The following general eligibility criteria and  restrictions apply to all first term Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preferences.  Additional  eligibility criteria and restrictions may apply to a specific Base of Preference option as shown  in paragraphs A2.2.3 and A2.2.4.\nA2.2.2.1.  A member may not apply for CONUS to CONUS Base of Preference  consideration prior to having 8 months\u2019 time-on-station and at least 12 months\u2019 time-on- station as of the projected departure date.  A member applies for overseas to CONUS Base  of Preference during their DEROS Forecast cycle.  There is no time-on-station minimum  to apply for in-place Base of Preference.\nA2.2.2.2.  Member has a category of enlistment of \u201c1\u201d; and never applied for a first term  Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preference.\nA2.2.2.3.  Member is selected under the Selective Reenlistment Program and has an  approved CJR.\nA2.2.2.4.  Member has not been selected for PCS nor has an assignment selection date.\nA2.2.2.5.  Member is not in AAC 05, 08, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, or 37 as  listed in Table 3.1, or ALC 02 or 08 as listed in Table 3.2.\nA2.2.2.6.  Member submits their application prior to reenlistment. Requests submitted  before reenlistment are processed even if the member reenlists before the Base of  Preference determination is made.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  451\nA2.2.2.7.  Consecutive Base of Preferences in any combination are not authorized.  There  must be an intervening PCS. (T-1) Example:  a first term Airman or Guardian who receives  an in-place Base of Preference cannot then receive a career Airman or Guardian PCS Base  of Preference immediately following.  Exception:  If one member of a military couple  receives a Base of Preference (assignment action reason A1 or A2) and the spouse is moved  as join spouse (assignment action reason A4), then upon eligibility at the next permanent  duty station, the member who PCS\u2019d under join spouse (assignment action reason A4) may  apply for a Base of Preference, in their own right and it would not constitute a consecutive  Base of Preference.\nA2.2.3.  First Term Airmen or Guardian Requests Without Retraining.\nA2.2.3.1.  CONUS to CONUS PCS (only).  May be considered regardless of overseas  vulnerability or stabilized tour status and member with a CONUS/overseas imbalanced  AFSC/SFSC may apply.  If disapproved, this constitutes use of the first term (or Guardian)  Base of Preference option.  Members may apply for a Career Airman (or Guardian) Base  of Preference when the member is eligible.\nA2.2.3.2.  Overseas to CONUS PCS.  PCS is upon completion of overseas tour (DEROS).   If disapproved this constitutes use of the first term Airman (or Guardian) Base of  Preference option, members may apply for a Career Airman (or Guardian) Base of  Preference when the member is eligible.\nA2.2.3.3.  In-Place (CONUS only).  Members list only their current base as the requested  Base of Preference location.  May be considered regardless of overseas vulnerability or  stabilized tour status and members with a CONUS/overseas imbalanced AFSC/SFSC may  apply.  If disapproved this constitutes use of the first term Airman (or Guardian) Base of  Preference option.  Members may apply for a Career Airman (or Guardian) Base of  Preference when they are eligible.\nA2.2.4.  First Term Airman or Guardian Requests With Retraining.\nA2.2.4.1.  CONUS to CONUS PCS; or In-Place; or overseas to CONUS PCS.\nA2.2.4.1.1.  Members request Base of Preference consideration at the same time they  apply for a CJR and retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFMAN 36-2100.  Base  of Preference consideration is in the AFSC/SFSC into which being retrained.  When a  Base of Preference is not desired, members enter the following in the Base of  Preference selection of the retraining application:  \u201cI have been briefed on Base of  Preference program for first term members and do not desire to apply.  I understand I  will not be given another opportunity to apply for a first term Airman (or Guardian)  Base of Preference.\u201d\nA2.2.4.1.2.  PCS is upon completion of overseas tour.  DEROS may be extended or  curtailed depending on retraining class start date.\nA2.2.4.1.3.  The action on a member\u2019s request will vary depending on preferences  stated and whether retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS.  Example:  if the  retraining is to a PCS course, then the Base of Preference consideration would be for  the first assignment after training is completed.  If a Base of Preference cannot be  approved, then assignment is based on the needs of the DAF.   452  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA2.2.4.1.4.  When retraining requests are approved, members must reenlist (not  extend) to obtain the required retainability to accept the retraining action as outlined in  AFMAN 36-2100. (T-1) The retraining retainability is described below:\nA2.2.4.1.4.1.  The amount of retraining retainability is normally less than that  required for a CONUS to CONUS PCS (that is 24 months).  Therefore, in order to  satisfy the PCS retainability requirement, members must satisfactorily complete the  retraining course and then reenlist in the new AFSC/SFSC before the member is  permitted to depart from the training location, regardless whether training is  attended in PCS or TDY enroute status. (T-1) If a member attending training in  PCS status refuses to reenlist, then the MPF will reclama the retraining PCS  assignment per paragraph 6.33. (T-1) When a member is attending in TDY  enroute status, a delay in obtaining retainability for PCS until award of the 3-skill  level is authorized as outlined in Table 6.5, rule 3 and note 6.\nA2.2.4.1.4.2.  The amount of retraining retainability normally satisfies the  requirement for overseas to CONUS PCS retainability when course attendance is  TDY enroute.  If a member is to attend a PCS training course they must reenlist  upon completion of the course and prior to departure on PCS. (T-1) If the member  refuses to reenlist, the MPF will not permit the member to depart the training  location and comply with the instructions in Table 6.5, note 6. (T-1)\nA2.2.4.1.5.  If the retraining request is disapproved then the Base of Preference request  is not considered and does not constitute use of the first term Airman (or Guardian)  Base of Preference option.  Members may request any of the Base of Preference options  for which they remain eligible.\nA2.3.  Career Airman or Guardian Program.\nA2.3.1.  General Information.  Career Airmen or Guardians may request a CONUS to CONUS  Base of Preference to PCS; or an In-Place Base of Preference to remain at their current CONUS  location, or both.  CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, overseas to CONUS, or in-place  Base of Preference at overseas locations are not authorized since these assignments are made  in accordance with EQUAL or GAT overseas and overseas returnee cycles and during the  DEROS Forecast cycle.  Preferences are considered in the exact order listed.  Manning at  current location must remain above the CONUS average after departure and manning at  gaining location must remain below the CONUS average upon arrival.\nA2.3.2.  Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions.  Members must be eligible for PCS without  waivers. (T-1) The following general eligibility criteria and restrictions apply to all Career  Airmen (or Guardians) Base of Preferences.\nA2.3.2.1.  Member has at least 41 months time-on-station (3 years, 5 months) at the time  of application and at least 4 years time-on-station before PCS departure.  There is no time- on-station minimum to apply for in-place Base of Preference.  Exception:  If currently  serving on a Maximum Stabilized Tour of at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 12  months (36 months time-on-station) and no later than 9 months (39 months time-on- station) before completing the stabilized tour.\nA2.3.2.2.  Member has a category of enlistment code of \u201c2\u201d or \u201c4\u201d and has been selected  under the Selective Reenlistment Program.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  453\nA2.3.2.3.  Member has not been selected for PCS nor has an assignment selection date.\nA2.3.2.4.  Member is not in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, 31, or  37 as listed in Table 3.1.\nA2.3.2.5.  Member has not been authorized Consecutive Base of Preferences in any  combination.\nA2.3.2.6.  Member has or is eligible to obtain the required retainability.\nA2.3.2.7.  Member is not an overseas volunteer nor has any other voluntary applications  pending.  This does not include Humanitarian or EFMP assignment applications.\nA2.3.2.8.  Members vulnerable for overseas PCS selection may apply; however, overseas  vulnerability is a factor in approval or disapproval.\nA2.3.2.9.  Members may ask for a Base of Preference in an awarded AFSC/SFSC other  than CAFSC/CSFSC; however, approval is based on the needs of the DAF.  A request for  this consideration should specifically be stated in the remarks of the in-system PDS request.   Note:  If a member returns to their previously awarded AFSC/SFSC the Base of Preference  is canceled and the AAC 28 is removed from PDS.  Example:  A MSgt First Sergeant  (8F000) receives an In-Place Base of Preference in June 2010 and then returns to her  previously awarded AFSC (3P071) following her 3 year First Sergeant duty in February  2011.  The Base of Preference does not transfer over to the 3P071 AFSC.\nA2.4.  Military Couples.  One or both members of a military couple may request Base of  Preference consideration in their own right when Base of Preference eligible; however, they both  must be PCS eligible and have join spouse intent code \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB.\u201d (T-1) If only one member is  submitting then manning must support a join spouse assignment in order for the Base of Preference  to be approved. (T-1) A military couple could be comprised of two first term Airmen or Guardians,  one first term Airman or Guardian and one Career Airman or Guardian, or two Career Airmen or  Guardians.\nA2.4.1.  The join spouse intent code is a major factor when considering the Base of Preference  request from a member.  If the intent code is \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d and only one member of the couple  is submitting a Base of Preference application, then the spouse will automatically be  considered for join spouse assignment in conjunction with their spouse\u2019s Base of Preference  request.  If manning supports and the request is approved, the Base of Preference eligible  member will receive a Base of Preference assignment (assignment action reason A1 (first term  Airman (or Guardian) Base of Preference) or A11 (Career Airman (or Guardian) Base of  Preference)) and their spouse will receive a join spouse assignment (assignment action reason  A4 (join spouse)).  If manning does not support the Base of Preference or join spouse  assignment, the Base of Preference request is disapproved.  Example:  If one member of a  military couple is currently serving a CONUS maximum tour (AAC 50) and meets the  eligibility criteria to apply, then they submit their Base of Preference request during their  eligibility window and their spouse (who does not meet Base of Preference eligibility criteria)  is considered for a join spouse assignment.\nA2.4.2.  When both member are eligible for Base of Preference consideration and submit  simultaneous Base of Preference applications the assignment preferences must match in the   454  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  same order. (T-1) When both applications are approved, then both members are moved under  the Base of Preference program (assignment action reason A1 or A2).\nA2.4.3.  When one member of a military couple requests a Base of Preference and the join  spouse intent code is \u201cH\u201d the request will be considered for only that member. (T-1) Refer to  Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.5.1 and A8.5.4.3 for information on how join spouse intent  code \u201cH\u201d will affect future join spouse assignment consideration.\nA2.5.  Application Procedures/Responsibilities.  Members submit their Base of Preference  application through myFSS.  Procedures and responsibilities for the member, Commander, MPF,  and AFPC are outlined in the Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide: Voluntary Assignments:   Base of Preference.\nA2.6.  Approval/Disapproval Guidance:  AFPC/DPM or ETMO assignment OPR will approve  or disapprove requests via PDS and update the assignment (for PCS Base of Preference approvals)  in accordance with the Active Duty Enlisted Voluntary Assignment Application Schedule located  on myFSS. (T-1)\nA2.6.1.  If a career Airman\u2019s request is approved, the MPF will ensure the Airman obtains 24  months service retainability within 30 days of approval notification. (T-1) Airman may only  request a delay in obtaining retainability as authorized in paragraph 4.6.6 and Table 6.5.\nA2.6.2.  When an in-place Base of Preference is approved, the AAC 28 is automatically  updated with an expiration date 24 months from date of approval.  For PCS Base of Preference,  the gaining MPF updates an AAC 28 upon in-processing with an expiration date 24 months  from date arrived station.  A voluntary request by a member to terminate the 2-year Base of  Preference deferment is submitted through the servicing MPF to the assignment OPR for  consideration.  If approved, the member cannot request a subsequent Base of Preference  deferment while assigned to that location.\nA2.6.3.  When a member\u2019s request is disapproved, the member may resubmit 6 months from  the date of disapproval.  There is no limit on the number of times a member may apply,  provided the member is eligible.\nA2.7.  Withdrawal/Cancellation Guidance:\nA2.7.1.  Withdrawal or cancellation of an approved Base of Preference (PCS or in-place) due  to member declining retainability, failing to obtain retainability, or when requested by the  member constitutes usage of Base of Preference.  No further Base of Preference consideration  is given.  Voluntary withdrawal of a Base of Preference application (PCS or in-place) prior to  final decision by AFPC or ETMO does not constitute usage of Base of Preference.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  455  Attachment 3  HOME-BASING (HB) AND FOLLOW-ON (FO) ASSIGNMENT PROGRAMS (REGAF  AND USSF ONLY)\nA3.1.  Purpose of the Home-Basing (HB) and Follow-On (FO) Program.  The HB and FO  Assignment programs were established to reduce PCS costs and increase family stability.  A HB  assignment may only be requested if assigned at a CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii location.  A FO  assignment may only be requested to a CONUS location or overseas long tour location (FO to  short tour locations are not authorized).  The HB and FO program goals are met when members  meet the criteria and agree to the conditions and limitations outlined in this attachment in exchange  for advance assignment consideration.\nA3.2.  HB/FO Program Criteria.  To be eligible for the HB or FO program, USAF members in  the grade of lieutenant colonel (or below) and SMSgt (or below); or USSF members in the grade  of lieutenant colonel (or below) and MSgt (or below), must:\nA3.2.1.  Have been selected for or elected to serve the overseas unaccompanied short tour  length of 15 months or less. (T-1)\nA3.2.1.1.  (For HB only)  .  If the officer or enlisted member is assigned in the CONUS,  Alaska, or Hawaii, then the member can only request for HB consideration back to the  location currently assigned.\nA3.2.1.2.  (For FO only)  .  If the officer or enlisted member is assigned in the CONUS,  Alaska, or Hawaii, then the member can request for FO consideration to any CONUS  location, Alaska, Hawaii, or any foreign overseas long tour location.\nA3.2.1.3.  (For FO only)  .  If the officer or enlisted member is assigned in a foreign  overseas location, then the member can only request FO consideration to any CONUS  location, Alaska or Hawaii.\nA3.2.1.4.  Members who are assigned in a foreign overseas location and are requesting a  FO to a foreign overseas location do not meet the criteria of the program.  Members  requesting FO consideration outside the criteria of the program, must apply as an exception  to policy in accordance with paragraph A3.7 with full justification of why they should be  considered outside the parameters of the program. (T-1)\nA3.2.2.  Have or be eligible to obtain the PCS retainability for the overseas unaccompanied  short tour and HB or FO assignment required by Table 6.4 and separation and retirement date  minimums for overseas PCS selection required by Table 6.6. (T-1) For requests for overseas  locations in Alaska or Hawaii, members must be able to obtain 36 months retainability in order  to serve the full prescribed overseas tour. (T-1) Retainability for an approved HB assignments  is obtained during normal overseas DEROS Option Window (within 30 days after DEROS  Option notification/election).  Retainability for approved FO assignments must be obtained  within 30 calendar days of approval notification. (T-1)\nA3.2.3.  Members may not be enroute to their first permanent duty station, and\nA3.2.4.  May not apply for a designated location move.   456  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA3.3.  HB/FO Restrictions/Limitations.  In exchange for advance assignment consideration,  members participating in the HB/FO program must agree not to use their allowances to relocate  their dependents and/or HHG to a place other than the FO location; or relocate their dependents to  a designated place, such as designated location move; or ship and/or store house hold goods (HHG)  at government expense (unless an exception has been authorized in paragraph A3.3.1 and A3.7).  (T-1) Any claim against the government for the relocation of dependents, or shipment of HHG to  other than the FO location, or for storage of HHG results in cancellation of the HB/FO assignment  (see paragraph 6.41.1.).\nA3.3.1.  Members who want to participate in the HB/FO program must agree to the restrictions  and limitations of the program. (T-1) The following are approved exceptions to the policy:\nA3.3.1.1.  Member with no dependents assigned to any location may store HHGs at govt  expense and retain Follow-On eligibility.  A single service member parent, or a member  that is part of a military couple who serves concurrent and separate unaccompanied short  tours, and is assigned in the CONUS, Alaska or Hawaii; these members may store (not  ship) household goods locally at government expense by the most cost effective means (as  determined by servicing TMO) and still retain their HB/FO assignment without requesting  an exception.  However, any relocation of dependents to a designated location is done at  personal expense (members not assigned in the CONUS or Alaska or Hawaii submits their  request as an exception to policy on their vMPF application).\nA3.3.1.2.  Members denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled  quarters may move their dependents and household goods off base (out of government  quarters) only within the same city, town, or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JTR,  and still retain their HB/FO assignment without requesting an exception.\nA3.3.1.3.  When required to reside off-base at the overseas unaccompanied short tour  location, members may ship household goods to the overseas unaccompanied short tour  location, if otherwise eligible as determined by TMO, and also receive single rate  dislocation allowance to assist them with establishing a household.  When household goods  shipment is authorized, or they receive single rate dislocation allowance, members may  retain the HB/FO assignment without requesting an exception.  The losing MPF verifies  the requirement to live off-base via myFSS (overseas furnishings and quarters availability  listing).\nA3.3.2.  (For FO only)  Members may not ship household goods to the FO location at  government expense when their dependents do not intend to establish a household within the  FO vicinity (daily commuting distance from FO base and household) since storage of  household goods at government expense is not allowed under the FO program.  By not  establishing a household at the FO location, storage of the household goods will be required,  but is not authorized under the FO program.  When a FO is approved, a member\u2019s dependents  are authorized to remain at their current location or relocate to the FO location at government  expense.       DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  457\nA3.4.  HB/FO Application Procedures.  Members receive counseling on the HB or FO program  during the initial PCS relocation briefing, on line or by their MPF, when selected for a dependent- restricted overseas tour and those who elect to serve a 15 month or less unaccompanied overseas  tour length.  Members apply for HB and/or FO by using the self-service application on vMPF and  per the procedures in the execution guidance in the myFSS website, Voluntary Assignments:   HB/FO Assignment Program.  Members should read the information very carefully as it  thoroughly explains conditions and restrictions of the HB/FO assignment program and to which  they must agree. (T-1) (Note:  Members without access to the vMPF use the memorandum  template in the execution guidance in the myFSS website.  After all signatures and final action has  been taken, the MPF sends the application to AFPC for filing in Automated Records Management  System according to DAFI 36-2608 and Attachment 2.)\nA3.4.1.  Members must either apply or decline to apply for a HB and/or FO assignment no  later than 150 calendar days prior to their RNLTD. (T-1) Example:  A member who is selected  for reassignment on 8 Nov 2012 with an RNLTD of 31 Aug 2013 must make an election NLT  4 Apr 2013.  If assignment notification is less than 150 days prior to the RNLTD, members  must make an election within 15 calendar days of assignment notification. (T-1) A member  unable to submit an application within 15 calendar days from assignment notification due to  mission reasons or emergency leave only, may apply immediately upon return with  justification and commander\u2019s concurrence.  Late requests based on reasons other than these  are not accepted.\nA3.4.2.  If the member declines participation in the HB/FO program, the MPF will enter the  HB/FO declination statement from OPA in item 24 of the member\u2019s PCS orders. (T-1)\nA3.4.3.  AFPC considers HB/FO assignments once a month, and a final decision will be made  NLT 120 calendar days prior to the member\u2019s RNLTD. The MPF Career Development  Element should suspense all HB/FO requests to ensure a reply is received from AFPC NLT  120 calendar days prior to the RNLTD. If a final decision on a HB/FO request has not been  received NLT 120 calendar days of the member\u2019s RNLTD, the MPF will immediately contact  the assignment OPR via CMS.\nA3.4.4.  Members receive HB/FO consideration only once so it is in their best interest that they  provide the maximum number of choices in priority sequence.  If a member requests both HB  and FO consideration on their application, the HB location takes priority over a FO location  and is considered first.  Members may apply for up to 8 CONUS locations (either bases, states,  or locales) and up to 8 overseas locations (bases or countries).  If both CONUS and overseas  locations are indicated, overseas preferences will be considered first (when HB is not  requested).  For members military couples, see paragraph A3.6.\nA3.5.  HB/FO Allowances.  The MPF will advise members that a HB/FO application cannot be  used to deny a member PCS allowances. (T-1) The application is a voluntary agreement by the  member not to use PCS allowances in exchange for advance assignment consideration.  If, after  approval of a HB/FO assignment, the member uses a PCS allowance the member originally agreed  not to use, that allowance cannot be denied; however AFPC will cancel the HB/FO assignment.  (T-1) Some members have personal requirements which may preclude them from entering into an  agreement not to use PCS allowances.  If participating in the HB/FO program would cause a  financial or personal hardship, members are encouraged to use their PCS allowances and not  participate in this program.  Exceptions to allow members to use their allowances (other than for   458  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  relocation to the FO location or as already approved as an exception in paragraph A3.3.1 or A3.7)  and receive HB/FO consideration are not considered.  Such exceptions to HB/FO criteria would  give a few members an unfair advantage over others who abide by HB/FO criteria.  In addition,  HB/FO consideration for assignments also reduces the available assignments to other overseas  short tour returnees.\nA3.6.  Military Couples.  When a member is married to another member of the U.S. Armed  Forces and serves a dependent-restricted tour or elects to serve the unaccompanied overseas tour  of 15 months or less, that member is considered for a return (join spouse) assignment to the location  of the spouse, unless join spouse intent code \u201cH\u201d (join spouse not desired) is reflected in the PDS  or the member requests FO consideration as outlined below:\nA3.6.1.  If no requirement exists at the spouse\u2019s location, the returning member\u2019s FO  preferences are considered for both members at that time.  A requirement must exist for both  members. (T-1)\nA3.6.2.  When both members of a military couple (with join spouse intent codes \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d)  are selected to serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours of 15 months or less  they may apply for FO assignments provided they each list the same preferences in the same  order on their respective FO applications.\nA3.6.3.  (Enlisted Only)  Members selected for an overseas assignment, including when a  requirement exists at their current base upon completion of their unaccompanied overseas short  tour, may request follow-on consideration and join spouse assignment to another CONUS  location if the spouse who remains at the current CONUS base has four years time-on-station  or more as of the DEROS (month/year) of the member returning from overseas.  The CONUS  spouse\u2019s join spouse intent code reflects \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d and the PDS application update contains  in the remarks section:  \u201cCONUS Follow-On Join Spouse Request - 4 Years time-on-station.\u201d\nA3.6.4.  (Enlisted Only)  Members selected for an overseas assignment, including when a  requirement exists at their current location upon completion of their unaccompanied overseas  short tour, may request follow-on and join spouse assignment consideration to an overseas  location.  The CONUS spouse\u2019s join spouse intent code reflects \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d and the PDS  application update contain in the remarks section:  \u201cOverseas Follow-On and Join Spouse  Request.\u201d\nA3.7.  FO Exception to policy.  Members currently serving at a foreign overseas location,  (example:  Ramstein AB, GE or Kadena AB, JA) and are requesting a FO to a foreign overseas  location are not eligible for FO consideration per paragraph A3.2, however they may request  consideration as an exception to policy ONLY.  Those that may request FO consideration as an  exception to policy are those members whose dependents are authorized to remain in the foreign  OCONUS location, e.g., civilian spouse is a citizen of the country they are requesting as the FO  location; or is a DoD civilian or contractor that has Status of Forces Agreement entitlements in  their own right.  The following are some examples:  Example 1:  MSgt Leathers is currently assigned to Ramstein AB, GE, and is married to a  Japanese national.  He is selected for an assignment to Kunsan AB, ROK, and wants to apply for  FO consideration to Kadena AB, JA.  He is eligible to request for FO as an exception to policy  and if approved, will move his dependents under the Dependent Travel to Designated  Place/Follow-On program in accordance with DAFI 36-3012.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  459    Example 2:  SSgt Alejandro is currently assigned to Ramstein AB, GE, and is married to DoD  civilian currently employed at Ramstein AB, GE, and has Status of Forces Agreement  entitlements in his own rights.  She is selected for an assignment to Izmir AS, TU, and wants to  apply for FO consideration back to Ramstein AB, GE.  She is eligible to request for FO as an  exception to policy because her DoD civilian spouse is authorized to remain behind based on his  Status of Forces Agreement entitlements.    Example 3:  Capt Tongson is currently assigned to Aviano AB, IT, and is married to a Korean  national.  He is selected for an assignment to Incirlik AB, TU, and has elected to serve the  unaccompanied tour length of 15 months, and wants to apply for FO consideration back to  Aviano AB, IT.  He is not eligible to request for FO as an exception to policy since his civilian  spouse is not a citizen of Italy.  Capt Tongson would only be eligible to request FO consideration  for a CONUS location, Alaska, or Hawaii.\nA3.7.1.  One of the main reasons such assignments are not permitted on a routine basis is that  Status of Forces Agreements seldom cover dependents once the member departs the overseas  country on PCS.  Similarly, Status of Forces Agreement seldom cover dependents that arrive  in a foreign country in advance of the member\u2019s arrival in PCS status.  Example:  Japan strictly  limits dependents residing without the military sponsor.  Also, these dependents cannot retain  command sponsorship and the member can only receive the overseas station allowances upon  special approval of a request according to the procedures in DAFI 36-3012.  As a point of  interest, although the dependent may be eligible to remain at the current location or travel to  the FO location, the dependent(s) will not be command sponsored and military housing may  not be available.  For these and related reasons, members and dependents should acknowledge  these circumstances and demonstrate the capability to cope before submitting a request for an  exception.\nA3.7.2.  Requests for an exception to policy FO is completed by the member in vMPF under  the HB/FO application or by memorandum in the PSD Guide, if vMPF is not available.  The  exception to policy will be sent via CMS by the MPF to the assignment OPR who will  coordinate the request with AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO for approval/disapproval. (T-1)  The MPF must ensure the following information is included in the request:\nA3.7.2.1.  FO preferences. (T-1)\nA3.7.2.2.  Member\u2019s marital status and whether spouse is a civilian. (T-1)\nA3.7.2.3.  Whether the member has dependents. (T-1)\nA3.7.2.4.  If married to a civilian spouse, or single with dependents, the location of  dependent(s). (T-1)\nA3.7.2.5.  If married, whether the civilian spouse is a foreign-born citizen.  If so, the  country in which the civilian spouse holds citizenship. (T-1)\nA3.7.2.6.  If married, whether the civilian spouse a U.S. government employee with  housing and Status of Forces Agreement entitlements in their own right. (T-1)        460  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA3.7.2.7.  If married to a civilian spouse, or single with dependents, will member request  a Dependents Remaining Overseas (DRO) or Dependent Travel to Designated Place  (DTDP)/FO application?  The member should be counseled in accordance with DAFI 36- 3012, and be provided the appropriate benefit entitlement fact sheet for overseas PCS for  noncommand-sponsored dependents found on myFSS.  A DRO or DTDP/FO application  is not mandatory for members to apply; however, members should be advised of all  available options. (T-1)\nA3.7.2.8.  If the member is not requesting a DRO or DTDP/FO, where will the  dependent(s) reside? (T-1)\nA3.7.2.9.  If single, what is the disposition of HHGs at the current foreign OCONUS  location? Has TMO authorized full shipment of HHGs to the short, dependent restricted  location? Has TMO verified no requirement for storage of HHGs?\nA3.7.2.10.  In addition, submit any other pertinent information that supports the basis for  the exception to policy request. (T-1)\nA3.8.  Approved HB Assignment for Alaska or Hawaii.  Members with an approved HB  assignment to Alaska or Hawaii who desire to have dependents remain in the overseas area must  submit a DRO application in accordance with DAFI 36-3012. (T-1)\nA3.9.  Approved FO Assignment to any Overseas Location.  Members with an approved FO  assignment to any overseas location who desire to have dependents remain in the overseas area or  relocate to the FO assignment location must submit a DRO or DTDP/FO application in accordance  with DAFI 36-3012. (T-1) All dependents must be medically cleared for government funded travel  prior to the member\u2019s departure to the unaccompanied short tour location. (T-1) In addition,  members who desire to relocate dependents and/or ship household goods to an overseas FO  location must be counseled in detail by the MPF and TMO on how the Status of Forces Agreement  may impact unaccompanied dependents and household goods in the overseas area. (T-1)\nA3.10.  Notification of Approval or Disapproval of HB/FO Applications.  Upon receipt of the  AFPC or ETMO decision, the MPF enters the appropriate HB/FO statement from OPA in item 24  of the member\u2019s PCS orders.  The MPF will send the application to be filed in Automated Records  Management System in accordance with DAFI 36-2608 and Attachment 2. (T-1)\nA3.11.  PCS Orders.  The MPF will not release PCS orders without a final decision on a HB/FO  application from the AFPC or ETMO assignment OPR. (T-1) PCS orders reflect the appropriate  HB/FO information according to DAFMAN 36-2102.  The proper assignment remark ensures the  FSO and TMO take actions consistent with the member\u2019s HB/FO agreement or advises the MPF  to cancel if the member uses PCS allowances.\nA3.12.  Voluntary Cancellation of a HB/FO Assignment.  Withdrawal or cancellation of an  approved HB/FO due to member declining retainability, failing to obtain retainability, or when  requested by the member constitutes usage of HB/FO.  No further HB/FO consideration will be  given.  A HB/FO assignment is considered to be voluntarily canceled by the member when:\nA3.12.1.  A member applies for a three month or longer extension of their overseas tour.  The  MPF updates the extension request and in the transaction remarks indicates the member has a  HB/FO assignment which must be canceled to accept the extension. (T-1) If the extension  request is disapproved, the HB/FO assignment remains firm.  A request for tour extensions of   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  461  2 months or less indicates in the transaction remarks the member has a HB/FO assignment  which requires an adjustment to the RNLTD per paragraph 6.32.  Also, members who extend  their short overseas tour may require additional retainability for the HB/FO assignment and  MPF must verify retainability per paragraph 4.6.6. (T-1)\nA3.12.2.  A member applies for and receives approval of a request for Humanitarian or EFMP  assignment.\nA3.12.3.  (For HB only)  .  A member who requests for voluntary cancellation of HB  assignment is submitted in accordance with paragraph 6.10, not later than 150 days prior to  member\u2019s DEROS.  Requests submitted within the 150-day time frame require humanitarian  or hardship reason(s).\nA3.13.  Involuntary Cancellation of a HB/FO Assignment.  Unlike a \u201cnormal\u201d assignment from  overseas, a HB/FO assignment is made 14 to 18 months before the reporting date.  Although the  intent is that once a HB/FO assignment is provided it remains firm, the member\u2019s qualifications  and Air Force or Space Force requirements remain the primary determinants.  When canceling a  HB/FO assignment becomes unavoidable (due to base closure, unit deactivation, HYT  adjustments, curtailment prior to meeting short tour credit criteria in accordance with Table 7.5,  etc.) the member is given priority consideration for other assignment preferences.  In addition,  there are other circumstances when involuntary cancellation of a HB/FO assignment may also be  appropriate.  When circumstances arise which may warrant involuntary cancellation of a HB/FO  assignment, the MPF must immediately notify AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO and the  assignment OPR via CMS, with an information copy to both the losing and gaining MPF. (T-1)  An assignment made under the HB/FO program will be involuntarily canceled by AFPC when:\nA3.13.1.  (For HB)  A member relocates dependents and/or ships or stores household goods  at government expense (for reasons other than the approved exceptions in paragraph A3.3.1  and A3.7. (T-1)\nA3.13.2.  (For FO)  A member relocates dependents and/or ships household goods to a  location other than the FO at government expense, receives dislocation allowance for  movement of dependents to a location other than the FO, or ships or stores household goods at  government expense (for reasons other than the approved exceptions in paragraph A3.3.1 and\nA3.7. (T-1)\nA3.13.3.  A member fails to comply with any of the provisions agreed to in the \"Home-Basing  and/or Follow-on Assignment Application.\" (T-1)      462  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 4  HOSTILE FIRE AND IMMINENT DANGER AREA REASSIGNMENT OR  DEFERMENT\nA4.1.  Purpose.  There are two separate assignment provisions addressed below.\nA4.1.1.  One is to allow one or more immediate family members to request reassignment from,  or deferment from assignment to, a hostile fire or imminent danger area when that family has  suffered a casualty incident to duty in a currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger  area.\nA4.1.2.  The other provision applies to assignment of members hospitalized because of hostile  fire action.\nA4.2.  General Provisions for Immediate Family Members.\nA4.2.1.  Members must be at least 18 years of age to serve in a hostile fire or imminent danger  area (T-0)\nA4.2.2.  Hostile fire and imminent danger areas are designated by geographical area with a  beginning date and a termination date in the DoD Pay and Entitlements Manual.\nA4.2.3.  Assignment to duty in a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area is shared as  equitably as practical by all similarly qualified members, except as indicated herein or in  Attachment 5, Sole Surviving Son or Daughter and Attachment 6, Aircrew Family Member  Assignment.  Assignment of military couples, including assignment at the same time, to the  same or different hostile fire or imminent danger areas is not precluded.\nA4.2.4.  Assignment includes TDY or PCS.\nA4.2.5.  Only the member may initiate a request for deferment or reassignment.  A request  may not be initiated by someone on behalf of a member.\nA4.2.6.  When a military member is killed or dies, is in a captured or missing status or has  been determined by the Veterans Administration (VA) or a military Service to have a physical  or mental disability rating of 100 percent as a result of an act committed by an individual,  group, or country hostile to the United States or in direct support of operations against such a  hostile force while serving in a currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, other  members of the same immediate family (as defined below) will be exempt, upon request, from  serving in the same or any currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, or if the  member is already serving in such an area, they will be reassigned from that area.  The intent  is when a family has suffered a casualty incident to service in a currently designated hostile  fire or imminent danger area, to not expose the remaining immediate family members to further  casualties in the same or any other currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area.   However, when an area in which a family member became a casualty ceases to be designated  as a hostile fire or imminent danger area, then members of that family may again be assigned  to that location.  It is not a requirement for the member who was a casualty to be living or to  still be on active duty, as long as the area in which the member became a casualty is still  currently designated.       DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  463\nA4.2.7.  For this provision, a member\u2019s immediate family members are:\nA4.2.7.1.  Parents.  This includes stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood in  the place of a parent for at least 5 years immediately preceding the initial entry on active  duty of the member who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled.\nA4.2.7.2.  Brothers and Sisters.  This includes stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or  sisters by adoption, or half-brothers or half-sisters in the household at the time the member  who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled initially entered active duty.\nA4.2.7.3.  Spouse.\nA4.2.7.4.  Natural child.\nA4.2.7.5.  Legally adopted child.\nA4.2.7.6.  Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member or  former member died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent  disabled.\nA4.2.7.7.  A child to whose support a male member or former member has been ordered  judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the father, or of  whom he has acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.\nA4.2.7.8.  A person for whom the member stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years  immediately preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was missing  or captured, or determined to be 100 percent disabled.\nA4.3.  Application Procedures/Responsibilities.  Applications should be submitted using the  PSD Guide: Hostile Fire and Imminent Danger Area Reassignment or Deferment, located on  myFSS, within 15 calendar days of notification of selection for PCS or TDY, or as soon after  becoming eligible as practical.  Members will submit requests to their unit commander. (T-3)\nA4.4.  Exceptions.  MPF may submit exception to policy requests they recommend be approved  to Assignment authority.  The Assignment authority may disapprove requests for exception or  submit those which merit approval through channels to DoD for final approval/disapproval.\nA4.5.  General Provisions for Members Hospitalized.  Members who have been hospitalized  for 30 or more calendar days because of a specific hostile fire action resulting from combat service  will not be returned to the hostile fire area during the same tour in which they were wounded.   Members reassigned under this provision will be eligible for subsequent hostile fire tours.   Members may return voluntarily to a hostile fire area earlier if the member is medically qualified.   This provision does not apply to members hospitalized for injury, accident, or illness not  attributable to hostile fire action.  Self-inflicted wounds and other non-combat causes are  specifically excluded.     464  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 5  SOLE SURVIVING SON OR DAUGHTER ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTION (REGAF  AND USSF ONLY)\nA5.1.  Purpose.  The sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction restricts an eligible  member from duties involving combat with the enemy and precludes assignment (including both  PCS and TDY) to any overseas hostile fire or imminent danger area as designated in the DoD  Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual.  This restriction does not preclude the  assignment of a sole surviving son or daughter to an overseas area where combat conditions are  nonexistent.\nA5.2.  Definition/Eligibility Criteria.\nA5.2.1.  A sole surviving son or daughter is a member who is the only surviving son or  daughter in a family where the father, or mother, or one or more sons or one or more daughters,  served in the U.S. Armed Forces, and as a direct result of the hazards of duty in the Service,  the father, or mother, or one or more sons or daughters:\nA5.2.1.1.  Was killed, or\nA5.2.1.2.  Died as a result of wounds, accident or disease, or\nA5.2.1.3.  Is in a captured or missing-in-action status, or\nA5.2.1.4.  Is permanently 100 percent physically disabled (including 100 percent mental  disability), as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs or one of the Military  Services.\nA5.2.2.  The requirement that death or disability be a direct result of the hazards of service  does not require that the family member's death or disability occur in combat or during  assignment to a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, but does require that death be  determined as in the line of duty.  (In general, in the line of duty means death or disability did  not occur while the person was in desertion status or voluntarily absent without authority for  more than 24 hours or voluntarily absent from a scheduled duty, a formation, a restriction, or  an arrest; by reason or a condition that existed before service, that was not service aggravated;  or as a result of their own misconduct (the term \"misconduct\" includes both willful misconduct  and gross negligence)).\nA5.2.3.  A member who is an only child (only son or only daughter), in itself, does not qualify  a member for the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction.\nA5.2.4.  The parent through whom a member seeks to qualify does not need to be living, but  the member must meet the criteria of sole surviving son or daughter, natural or adopted, of that  parent.\nA5.2.5.  Requests may be submitted on behalf of a member by their parent or spouse.  In this  case the member can waive the parental/spousal request before further processing.  If waived,  return the documentation to the member and file a copy of the waiver in the member\u2019s  electronic Automated Records Management System record.  No further processing is required.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  465\nA5.3.  Situations which do meet the criteria to qualify as a sole surviving son or daughter:\nA5.3.1.  The only son and only daughter of a mother or father who meets the criteria in  paragraph A5.2, both qualify as a sole surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.\nA5.3.2.  There are 3 children in a family; two boys and a girl.  One of the boys meets the  criteria in paragraph A5.2, therefore, the two remaining children (one boy and one girl) both  qualify as a sole surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.\nA5.3.3.  A member is an only child and one parent is also on active component.  While on  approved leave, the active component parent is killed while a passenger in the crash of a U.S.  civilian commercial passenger aircraft.  The parent's death is determined by the Air Force to  be in the line of duty (see paragraph A5.2.2.).  Since the criteria in paragraph A5.2 is met,  the child qualifies as a sole surviving son/daughter.  The finding that death was in the line of  duty meets the requirement that death was as a direct result of the hazards of service.\nA5.4.  Situations which do not meet the criteria of sole surviving son or daughter:\nA5.4.1.  A family has one child (boy or girl).  The child is on active component in the Air  Force or Space Force.  The fact that a child is an only child does not, in itself, qualify the child  for the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction.\nA5.4.2.  A family has one child (boy or girl).  The child is on active component in the Air  Force or Space Force.  The father (or mother) dies of natural causes.  The child is not a sole  surviving son or daughter since the criteria in paragraph A5.2 is not met.\nA5.4.3.  There are 3 children in a family, two sons and a daughter.  One son and the daughter  are members.  The son who is not in the Air Force or Space Force is killed in a car accident.   Neither the remaining son nor the remaining daughter qualify as a sole surviving son or  daughter since the criteria in paragraph A5.2 is not met.\nA5.5.  Application Procedures.  Applications should be submitted as outlined in the PSD Guide:   Sole Surviving Son or Daughter Assignment Restriction.     466  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 6  AIRCREW FAMILY MEMBER ASSIGNMENT\nA6.1.  Purpose.  The policy is intended to provide aircrew members an avenue to apply for a PCA  or PCS when another member of the immediate family is in the same unit.  For this program, a  member\u2019s immediate family is defined as their:\nA6.1.1.  Parents, to include stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood in the place  of a parent for at least 5 years immediately preceding the initial entry on active component of  the member who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled.\nA6.1.2.  Brothers and sisters, to include stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or sisters by  adoption, or half-brothers or half-sisters in the household at the time the member who died, is  missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled initially entered active component.\nA6.1.3.  Spouse.\nA6.1.4.  Natural child.\nA6.1.5.  Legally adopted child.\nA6.1.6.  Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member or  former member died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent disabled.\nA6.1.7.  A child to whose support a male member or former member has been ordered  judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the father, or of whom  he has acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.\nA6.1.8.  Other person for whom the member stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years  immediately preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was missing or  captured, or determined to be 100 percent disabled.\nA6.2.  Aircrew Family Member Criteria.  Exposure to a common danger represented by serving  as an aircrew member in the same unit is sufficient reason for all but one member of an immediate  family to request reassignment to a different unit or location.  Only aircrew members may request  reassignment.\nA6.3.  Application Procedures.  Applications should be submitted using the PSD Guide: Aircrew  Family Member Assignments, located on myFSS.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  467  Attachment 7  CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENT ASSIGNMENT CONSIDERATION AND  CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENT HOME STATION ASSIGNMENT DEFERMENT  PROGRAM (REGAF AND USSF ONLY)\nA7.1.

A7.3.  Application Timelines.
A7.3.1.  If a member has 24 months (if requesting overseas assignment consideration) or 36  months (if requesting CONUS assignment consideration) or more time-on-station as of return  from the contingency deployment, the member must apply no later than 60 days upon return.  (T-1)
A7.3.2.  If a member has less than 24 months (if requesting overseas assignment consideration)  or 36 months (if requesting CONUS assignment consideration) time-on-station as of return  from the contingency deployment, the member must apply no later than 60 days upon obtaining  24 or 36 months time-on-station. (T-1)
A7.4.  Application Procedures.  Members must apply upon return from their contingency  Deployment (or upon eligibility) within the application timelines stated in paragraph A7.3. (T-1)
A7.5.  Approval/Disapproval.  Career field manning at members’ s preference locations,  member’s overseas vulnerability, and needs of the DAF are the deciding factor to approve or  disapprove.
A7.5.1.  Members electing consideration for a 24-month home station assignment deferment.   If approved, the AFPC assignment team will update AAC 39 with an expiration date of 24  months after the contingency deployment return date.

A7.5.2.  Members electing consideration for an assignment.  If approved, the AFPC or ETMO  assignment team will update the assignment in the PDS with an RNLTD no less than 120 days  from the date of approval to allow sufficient time for outprocessing actions. (T-1)
A7.5.3.  Once an assignment or 24-month assignment deferment has been approved or  disapproved, this constitutes the member exercising their option under this program and  reconsideration is not authorized.  Member may request cancellation of their assignment or  deferment in accordance with paragraph 6.10.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  469  Attachment 8  ASSIGNMENT OF MILITARY COUPLES – JOIN SPOUSE ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM  (REGAF AND USSF ONLY)
A8.1.  General Guidance.  Assignment authorities will attempt to facilitate the assignment of  dual-career military married couples to the same geographic area.  Each member of a military  couple is serving in their own right.  This means military couples fulfill the obligations inherent to  all members and they are considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and  perform duties which require the skills in which they are trained and experienced subject to their  PCS eligibility.  Provided this criteria is met, military couples may be considered for an assignment  where they can maintain a joint residence.  The assignment of military couples is also referred as  a join spouse assignment. Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family separation.   They should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based  on the assumption they can always be assigned to the same location or join spouse assignment is  guaranteed.  Military couples, like members with a civilian spouse, should expect periods of  separation during their careers.  When a join spouse assignment is not in the best interests of the  Air Force or Space Force, then, regardless of the provisions in this attachment, join spouse  assignment is not made.
A8.2.  Who Is Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration.  Members are eligible for  join spouse assignment consideration if:
A8.2.1.  The member is on EAD with the Air Force or Space Force and their spouse is also on  EAD with a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces (includes members of the U.S. Coast Guard, but  excludes military services of foreign countries) and the member and their spouse are not  ineligible for consideration for any of the reasons in paragraph A8.3, and
A8.2.2.  The member meets all PCS eligibility requirements established in this instruction  (such as time-on-station, retainability, quality control, etc.), and
A8.2.3.  The member has join spouse intent code “A” or “B,” and
A8.2.4.  The member and their spouse are not scheduled for reassignment, separation,  retirement, or release from active component within 12 months from the date the member is  projected to join the spouse at their location.
A8.2.5.  Join spouse assignments are permitted along with assignment programs in this  instruction if the provisions above and the criteria for each assignment program are met.
A8.3.  Who Is Not Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration.  Members are not  eligible for join spouse assignment:
A8.3.1.  If the member’s spouse is a member of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) or a  Reserve or Guard component of another branch of the U.S. Armed Forces whether or not the  spouse is serving on EAD.
A8.3.2.  If the member’s spouse is a member in the ARC who is on active component for  training, or on active component to fill a specific manpower authorization or position at a  predetermined location for a specified period of time.  In other words, if the spouse is not  subject to the PCS criteria outlined in this instruction, then the member is ineligible for join  spouse assignment consideration.   470  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024
A8.3.3.  If the member’s spouse is a non-military employee of the U.S. Government (example:   Civil Service).
A8.3.4.  If the member does not meet all PCS eligibility criteria established in this instruction  (such as time-on-station, retainability, quality control, etc.).
A8.3.5.  When join spouse intent code is "H."  When one member is selected for assignment  with intent code "H" a join spouse assignment is not provided.  Also, a join spouse assignment  request to that location at a later time is not authorized.  Join spouse assignment is not  considered until the subsequent PCS of the member or their spouse, provided join spouse intent  code is "A" or "B."  However, the member may receive an assignment to their spouse’s location  if the member is eligible under some other assignment program.
A8.3.5.1.  Changing join spouse intent code to "H" after selection for join spouse  assignment does not result in automatic cancellation of the assignment.  Normal reclama  procedures apply and the decision to cancel the join spouse assignment is made by the  assignment OPR based on the best interests of the DAF.  A member who requests and has  a join spouse assignment canceled as provided in this paragraph does so with the  understanding the member created the family separation.  A join spouse assignment to that  same location at a later time is not authorized.  Join spouse assignment is not considered  until the subsequent PCS of the member or their spouse, provided join spouse intent code  is "A" or "B."  However, the member may receive an assignment to their spouse’s location  if the member is eligible under some other assignment program.  AAC 32 is deleted when  either updates intent code “H.”
A8.3.6.  If the member or their spouse are projected for reassignment, separation, retirement,  or release from the active component within 12 months from the date the member is projected  to join the spouse at their location.
A8.3.7.  To overseas locations where there is no government-approved accompanied housing  or where election of an accompanied tour is not an option for either member.  Note:  In the  event both members should receive assignments (regardless of how it occurred) to the same or  adjacent dependent-restricted locations or where Command Sponsor billets are not available,  the MPF will reclama the assignment of the member selected last (includes when the marriage  takes place after assignment selection).  However, in the event that both members should  receive assignments to Osan AB and Kunsan AB, Korea; Incirlik AB, Turkey; or Lajes Field,  Portugal, concurrent Join Spouse assignment to the same dependent restricted 12-month short  tour shall be allowed. (T-1)
A8.3.8.  To locations not considered in proximity for join spouse assignment purposes as  described in paragraph A8.7.2.  Other options such as retraining (Enlisted, see AFMAN 36- 2100) or DAFSC/DSFSC changes (officers, see paragraph 6.48) are considered first as  explained in paragraph A8.7.1.
A8.3.9.  Based on intended or planned marriages.
A8.3.10.  If the member’s spouse is attending a training course and has less than 12 months  remaining until graduation (or has less than 12 months remaining upon the member’s arrival).
A8.3.11.  If the member’s spouse is a member of the military service of a foreign country.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  471
A8.4.  Documenting Marriages of Military Couples.  The MPF must verify the marriage from  the marriage certificate and update PDS and DEERS as prescribed in PSD Guide:  Join Spouse  Assignment Program. (T-1) Members may update their join spouse intent code via the vMPF once  the MPF has made the appropriate updates in PDS.  Military couples must report any change in  marital or military status (divorce, legal separation, death of the spouse, or separation or retirement  of the spouse) to the MPF so join spouse assignment information and AAC 32 (if applicable) is  deleted from the PDS. (T-1)
A8.5.  How Military Couples Receive Join Spouse Assignment Consideration.  The  characteristics of the enlisted and officer assignment systems affect how join spouse assignment  consideration is provided.  The enlisted assignment selection process makes extensive use of the  computer-match while officer assignment matches are a manual process.  Example:  the majority  of enlisted assignments to overseas locations (regardless of volunteer status) are computer- matched based on PCS eligibility, grade, and AFSC/SFSC, and then reviewed and validated by an  assignment NCO.  For these computer-matched assignments, the computer automatically  considers the spouse for join spouse assignment, and provided the eligibility criteria are met,  selects the spouse.  On the other hand, all officer assignments are manually worked by AFPC or  ETMO assignment officers to identified requirements.  However, the basic rule that a requirement  exists for the spouse’s AFSC/SFSC does not differ in either system.
A8.5.1.  Both Members are Officers.  Officers indicate they desire join spouse consideration  on their Airman Development Plan (USAF only), have either join spouse intent code “A” or  “B” in PDS, and ensure their assignment preferences match.  They should maintain periodic  contact with their respective assignment officers and ensure their join spouse intent code  remains current.  Judge advocates indicate their join spouse consideration on their Personal  Data Information.
A8.5.2.  Both Members are Enlisted.  When currently assigned to the same location (provided  neither has been selected for PCS), an accurate join spouse intent code (updated through  vMPF) provides continuous join spouse assignment consideration unless coded otherwise (see  paragraph A8.6.1 for those situations requiring an application).  It is the couple's  responsibility to let it be known in advance they desire join spouse assignment consideration  by updating their intent code in vMPF.  Improper completion or failure to update the intent  code jeopardizes join spouse assignment opportunities.  Join spouse assignment desires  indicated via the vMPF take priority over any other individual assignment preferences listed  in PDS (i.e., If a member’s intent code is "B," the main consideration is to try and keep the  couple together, not necessarily at a base of choice).  While location preferences are  considered, the join spouse intent code takes priority.
A8.5.3.  One Member is an Officer and one member is Enlisted.  Military couples consisting  of an officer and enlisted member receive assignment consideration primarily based on the  officer’s utilization.
A8.5.4.  The update of join spouse intent codes in the vMPF allows members to indicate the  extent of join spouse assignment consideration desired by use of one of the following join  spouse intent codes:
A8.5.4.1.  Code "A" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any overseas tour (including  concurrent dependent-restricted short tours).  The member and their spouse will be  considered for join spouse assignment to locations in the CONUS, at overseas accompanied   472  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  locations, overseas unaccompanied short tour locations, and overseas dependent-restricted  locations.  By updating intent code "A," the military couple has stated that they want to be  considered for concurrent unaccompanied short tour locations and dependent-restricted  short tours.  Both join spouse intent codes reflect “A” and both update dependent-restricted  or unaccompanied short tour preferences.  If one member of the military couple is selected  for reassignment to a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour location, the other  member of the military couple are considered for a concurrent, but separate reassignment  to a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour location.  If one member of the  military couple cannot be supported for a concurrent but separate dependent-restricted or  unaccompanied short tour location then neither members will be selected as a volunteer.
A8.5.4.2.  Code "B" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any accompanied overseas tour  (including non-concurrent dependent-restricted short tours).  The member and their spouse  will be considered for join spouse assignment to locations in the CONUS and at overseas  accompanied locations and only one member of the military couple will be selected for a  dependent-restricted short tour or unaccompanied short tour.  Stated another way, one  member of the military couple serves the dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour  while the other member of the military couple remains at their current location.  By  updating intent code “B,” the military couple has stated they do not desire to be selected  for concurrent dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tours.  Both join spouse intent  codes will reflect “B” and update of tour preferences are as follows:
A8.5.4.2.1.  If only one member of a military couple desires to be considered to serve  a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour while the other member of the  military couple remains at their current location, then both join spouse intent codes  reflect “B” but only one updates their dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour  preferences.  The member that remains at their current location does not have a  dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour preference updated.
A8.5.4.2.2.  If each member of a military couple desires to be considered to serve a  dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour while the other member of the  military couple remains at their current location, then both join spouse intent codes  reflect “B” and both update dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour  preferences.  However, only one member is selected since their intent code is “B.”
A8.5.4.3.  Code "H" Join spouse assignment not desired.  Members should use caution  when updating their intent code to “H.”  This should only be updated when a military  couple is filing for divorce and they no longer desire to be considered for join spouse  assignments.  Additionally, members may change their intent code to “H” when their  spouse has an approved retirement or separation date on file and the spouse is scheduled  for release from active component within 12 months.  Code “H” indicates to the assignment  OPR that the military couple no longer meets the criteria of join spouse assignment  consideration per paragraph A8.3.6, and AAC 32 is deleted when intent code “H” is  updated for either member.
A8.5.5.  When a member is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an overseas  assignment (where an accompanied tour is authorized) or as the most eligible non-volunteer  for a CONUS to CONUS assignment, and their join spouse intent code indicates join spouse  assignment is desired (codes "A" or "B"), then the spouse is provided an assignment to the   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  473  same or adjacent location if eligible for PCS and a vacancy exists.  If a join spouse assignment  is not possible, narrative remarks in the assignment transaction are included for the member  originally selected giving the reasons why a join spouse assignment cannot be approved so the  members can be counseled accordingly.
A8.5.6.  In order to be eligible for selection for an overseas assignment as a volunteer, with  join spouse intent code "A" or "B," requirements for both members need to be advertised on  the EQUAL or GAT for the same or adjacent locations or if either member is selected as the  most eligible volunteer, the spouse receives join spouse consideration based on manning over  the next six-month period from the RNLTD of the selected member.  Approval is based on  vacancies versus requirements and both RNLTDs match.  Because PDS only checks for  requirements within the cycle, the AFPC or ETMO assignment OPR must coordinate with the  spouse’s assignment OPR to determine if a vacancy exists to support a join spouse assignment.  (T-1)
A8.5.7.  (RegAF only)  While the EQUAL is used by join spouse couples volunteering for  overseas assignments, it is not used for overseas returnees.  Requirements advertised on the  EQUAL are for single service members, members with civilian spouses, and military couples  members with intent code "H" returnees only.  Return join spouse assignments are hand- matched because of the many variables involved, such as unique grade and AFSC  combinations.  It is important members keep their assignment preferences updated in the event  of changes in requirements (but remember join spouse intent code ensures join spouse  consideration and takes priority over individual preferences).
A8.5.8.  If a member is in the CONUS and the spouse is returning from overseas, the initial  join spouse consideration is to return to the spouse’s CONUS location.  If there is no  requirement at the spouse’s CONUS location and the spouse in the CONUS meets PCS  eligibility criteria, then he or she is considered for join spouse assignment to the overseas  returnee’s projected CONUS location.  Enlisted military couples who desire CONUS or  overseas assignment consideration in conjunction with the overseas follow-on program, see  paragraph A3.6.4.
A8.5.9.  When a member is serving in a CONUS stabilized tour and their spouse is selected  for reassignment, the following options apply:
A8.5.9.1.  If the spouse is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an overseas  assignment to an accompanied tour location or for a CONUS assignment, the member may  request release from the stabilized tour for join spouse assignment.  If approved, reporting  date depends whether or not a replacement is necessary, reporting date of replacement, etc.   If disapproved, the member selected as the most eligible non-volunteer will proceed on the  assignment.
A8.5.9.2.  If the spouse is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an overseas  assignment to a dependent-restricted location, then join spouse assignment is not  authorized.  The spouse may request a home-basing assignment to return to the member’s  stabilized tour location.
A8.5.10.  When members marry while both are technical training students they should apply  for join spouse assignment as soon as possible to receive consideration for assignment together  upon graduation.  If necessary, both members are retained at the training center pending final   474  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  join spouse decision by the assignment OPR.  When one member is a student, the member may  apply to join the spouse at the spouse’s permanent duty location, or if the non-student spouse  is also selected or scheduled for PCS, join spouse assignment to the non-student's new duty  station may be requested.
A8.5.11.  When one member of an enlisted military couple serves an unaccompanied overseas  short tour and upon completion of the overseas tour a join spouse assignment is desired to a  location other than the spouse’s current location, assignment consideration in conjunction with  the assignment follow-on program to a location other than the spouse’s current location may  be requested in limited circumstances as outlined in paragraph A8.6.
A8.6.  How Military Couples Request Join Spouse Assignment Consideration.  There are  different ways to request join spouse assignment consideration.  USAF officers follow procedures  under Air Force Assignment System guidelines (judge advocates update their PDI to reflect the  join spouse request) and USSF officers follow procedures under Guardian Assignment Timeline  guidelines.  Updating the join spouse intent code in vMPF (after the MPF updates the marriage in  PDS and DEERS) provides join spouse assignment consideration for enlisted member as provided  in paragraph A8.6.2.  Some situations require members to submit a letter application (see PSD  Guide:  Join Spouse Assignment Program) in order to receive join spouse assignment  consideration.
A8.6.1.  Application Procedures.  A letter application must be submitted for the following  reasons to receive join spouse assignment consideration. (T-1):
A8.6.1.1.  Each time the member of an interservice military couple desires join spouse  assignment consideration.  Also, when the interservice spouse is notified of assignment  and the member desires join spouse assignment.  In addition, a statement from the  interservice spouse indicating concurrence for join spouse assignment must accompany  each application, (T-1), or
A8.6.1.2.  When members marry while assigned to separate locations.  Provided both meet  PCS eligibility criteria, either member may apply.  Regardless of who applies, military  requirements dictate which member is reassigned, or
A8.6.1.3.  When the marriage occurs after the assignment selection of one or both  members, or
A8.6.1.4.  When members marry while enroute to assignments at different locations.   Members should understand they cannot delay join spouse assignment application until  arrival at their respective locations.  Members who marry enroute report to the nearest Air  Force or Space Force installation and submit an application immediately after marriage.   The MPF will contact the assignment OPR by telephone to initiate the enroute join spouse  request, then send an email with documentation to request join spouse assignment  consideration. (T-1) No reimbursement for any travel in conjunction with such application  is authorized and status is leave (delay enroute) while the application is pending.  A change  in port call and/or RNLTD may be appropriate.  When a member arrives in the local area  of assignment, whether or not "signed in," for assignment purposes the PCS is complete  and time-on-station requirements and other PCS eligibility criteria must be met before a  subsequent move to join spouse, (T-1),  or       DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  475
A8.6.1.5.  When military spouse information is incorrect in the PDS, or
A8.6.1.6.  When vMPF is not available.
A8.6.2.  Upon marriage and if the spouse is assigned to a separate location, the member  contacts the MPF for help in applying for join spouse assignment.  The servicing MPF makes  sure that:
A8.6.2.1.  The member meets all PCS eligibility criteria and understands all assignment  conditions.
A8.6.2.2.  The member is counseled on their allowance of dependent travel, shipment of  household goods, and any other information related to the PCS.
A8.6.2.3.  The members does not have a pending application for any self-initiated  assignment programs.
A8.6.2.4.  The member provides a statement from the spouse indicating join spouse  assignment is desired which must accompany the member’s application in an interservice  marriage.
A8.6.3.  In those situations for enlisted couples where the join spouse intent code is properly  updated but simultaneous assignments did not flow, the MPF should ensure member is fully  aware of join spouse eligibility requirements, and that, if eligible, spouse should immediately  submit a request for join spouse assignment.
A8.6.3.1.  The MPF checks eligibility, suspenses a copy of the application, and transmits  the request through PDS to the assignment OPR (refer to the PSD Guide for update  procedures).
A8.6.3.2.  The assignment OPR makes the assignment decision and establishes the  RNLTD based on manning requirements.  Approval is transmitted to the MPF via PDS.
A8.7.  Approval Guidelines.  Join spouse assignments are usually approved when the eligibility  criteria are met by both members and assignment is consistent with the needs of the DAF (based  primarily on grade and AFSC/SFSC).  Officer join spouse assignments can be more difficult  because of variable qualification factors.  Sometimes approval may not be possible, due to  limitations and restrictions involved in each case.  Some situations inherently limit join spouse  assignment possibilities, such as when the spouse is in another U.S. military service, is assigned  to school for training, special duty assignment, at a location where the spouse's AFSC/SFSC is not  authorized, on a stabilized tour, etc.
A8.7.1.  If the assignment OPR is unable to assign the military couple together based on their  current AFSC/SFSCs, a member may request utilization in a previously awarded AFSC/SFSC  or apply for retraining, if eligible, and an officer, if eligible, may apply for a DAFSC/DSFSC  change to facilitate join spouse assignment.  Approval of this type of request depends on Air  Force or Space Force requirements.  However, retraining or a DAFSC/DSFSC change request  while in technical training, or within 12 months following graduation, for the sole purpose of  join spouse assignment is not authorized.  Note:  Enlisted members may request, as an  exception, an AFSC/SFSC change during technical training when join spouse assignment  opportunities are extremely limited or nonexistent because of incompatible AFSC/SFSCs  between the couple.  These requests may be considered based on the relative need in both   476  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  AFSC/SFSCs when the training capability exists at the current location, training already  received for the requested AFSC/SFSC, and no interruption in training occurs.
A8.7.2.  In order to provide optimum consideration for join spouse assignment, CONUS  assignments to adjacent locations may be approved when the locations are close enough to  allow establishing a joint household (usually no more than 50 miles apart between duty  locations).  Overseas locations have numerous variables involved, such as weather and road  conditions, cost of living, commute time, and availability of housing, etc.  Because of these  variables, AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO determines which overseas locations are within  close proximity to support a join spouse assignment.
A8.7.3.  Involuntary Separation of Military Couples.  USAF lieutenant colonel (and below)  and SMSgt (and below) or USSF lieutenant colonel (and below) and MSgt (and below)  assignments outside the parameters authorized in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3, will require  approval by the AFPC/CC.  This authority will not be further delegated. (T-2)
A8.8.  Miscellaneous Instructions.
A8.8.1.  If the members have dependents, when assignment is to an overseas location where  an accompanied tour is authorized, follow the dependent travel request procedures according  to DAFI 36-3012.  This is necessary to obtain a housing availability determination for the  family, for household goods shipment, and so forth.  Where there are severe housing shortages,  the initial request for concurrent travel may be disapproved; however, there are categories of  exceptions, and one of these is usually military couples with dependents.  A delay in RNLTD  for one member of the couple may be requested, but couples should be advised to make  arrangements for the care of their dependents in the event both proceed as scheduled.  If  concurrent travel is authorized but later becomes impractical (for personal or official reasons),  a change of RNLTD may be requested from the assignment OPR.  Include the specific reasons  the change is being requested.
A8.8.2.  Military couples with dependents who have concurrent assignments to separate  dependent-restricted locations must make dependent care arrangements. (T-1) Refusal or  inability to arrange care for dependents may result in disciplinary action and (or) involuntary  separation (see DoDI1342.19_AFI 36-2908).
A8.8.3.  Military couples selected for reassignment (or assigned) to the same or adjacent  location are each deferred for 24 months (see Table 6.2.).  When assigned where an  accompanied tour is authorized (overseas), each must serve the accompanied tour length (plus  12 months for enlisted couples if either was selected as an extended tour volunteer) regardless  of the assignment action reason which applied to either assignment. (T-1) When assignment is  to the same or adjacent location and the couple are to reside jointly, ensure Block 14 is  completed on both members’ PCS orders to document the join spouse assignment, regardless  of the assignment action reason.  This ensures proper household goods weight allowance and  correct tour length when assignment is overseas.  When marriage occurs after both are assigned  overseas at the same or adjacent location, each may retain the original tour length or volunteer  to serve the accompanied tour.
A8.8.4.  Assignment OPRs make the assignment decision and establish the RNLTD based on  manning requirements.  Normally, assignment approvals are transmitted to the MPF by PDS.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  477
A8.8.5.  If assigned overseas on a join spouse assignment and the DEROS month does not  match, the member with the earlier DEROS must extend their DEROS if he or she desires to  be reassigned at the same time. (T-1) Failing to match DEROS months reduces the chance for  join spouse assignment upon completion of the overseas tour.  Curtailment of the later arriving  member’s DEROS for the purpose of reassignment at the same time is not authorized.
A8.9.  Assignment Restrictions.  Military couples who are assigned PCS to the same or adjacent  CONUS location, regardless of the assignment action reason, are usually not reassigned for a  period of 24 months from the date arrived station of the latest arriving member.  The MPF places  both members in AAC 32 according to Table 6.2.  Any later availability date for other reasons for  either member remains in effect.  If married while serving at the same location, the MPF will not  update AAC 32. (T-1) When military couples are being assigned PCS to separate locations in  proximity and will establish a joint household, the losing MPF contacts the gaining MPF at both  spouse's location to verify location of assignment and coordinate whether or not update of AAC  32 is appropriate. (T-1) AAC 32 is not updated on couples assigned in excess of 50 miles apart  unless specifically authorized by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO as an exception in accordance  with paragraph 5.5.     478  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 9  AIR FORCE OFFICER ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM (OFFICERS - LT COL AND BELOW)  (REGAF ONLY)
A9.1.  Purpose.  The policy in this Attachment applies to RegAF only and is not applicable to  USSF.  The primary goal of the Air Force Officer Assignment System is to assign the right officer  to the right position at the right time to meet Air Force mission requirements.  Other considerations  include an officer’s professional development, Development Team Vectors (when available),  commander’s recommendations and member’s personal preferences.  Assignment of judge  advocates do not fall under the purview of Air Force Officer Assignment System.
A9.2.  How Air Force Officer Assignment System Works.  AFPC Officer Assignment Teams  are comprised of officers who usually hold the same AFSC as that of the career field being  managed.  Having intel officers work intel officer assignments, fighter pilots work fighter pilot  assignments, and so on, allows for insight into the unique manning and qualification requirements  for positions in that specialty.  The Air Force Officer Assignment System is managed through the  Assignment Management System (AMS) and by use of the Airman Development Plan.  The  components of AMS are discussed in the following paragraphs.
A9.3.  Personnel Requirements Display.  The Personnel Requirements Display provides officers  a planning tool by displaying assignment opportunities around the world.  It is available through  the AMS web page and consists of two parts, the authorizations listing and the requirements listing.
A9.3.1.  Authorizations Listing.  This lists, by AFSC and location, all unclassified positions  within each specialty across the Air Force as reflected on Air Force manpower files, and  provides officers an idea of the different types of positions available throughout the Air Force.   Officers may use this listing to aid in long term career planning.  This listing is updated monthly  to reflect the latest authorization changes.
A9.3.2.  Requirements Listing.  This lists projected requirements which AFPC will work to fill  during the current Air Force Officer Assignment System cycle, and is available to help officers  who are eligible for reassignment.  It is important to remember that not all requirements will  be listed, and some requirements listed may not be filled via a PCS move.  Direct-hire positions  and short-notice fills are examples of requirements which may not receive visibility.   Remember this portion of the Personnel Requirements Display is only a projection of the  vacancies/positions that will be worked for the current assignment cycle, and will only be  visible during the established visibility windows defined by the Air Force Officer Assignment  System timeline located on myFSS.
A9.4.  The Airman Development Plan.  The Airman Development Plan is the primary  mechanism for an officer to communicate career desires to the commander, senior rater,  assignment officer, and developmental team.  The Airmen Development Plan is a web-based  application containing the Development Plan and other tools to support Force Development.   When an officer completes a Development Plan for command selection or developmental  education, the document can only be submitted to AFPC by the senior rater.
A9.4.1.  When to Submit a Development Plan.  Officers should update their Airman  Development Plan annually.  It is very important to have a current Airman Development Plan  as an officer reaches developmental milestones such as selection to major or lieutenant colonel,   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  479  completion of Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE), Senior Developmental Education  (SDE), Command, or any time their record will be reviewed by their respective developmental  team.  Otherwise, Assignment Officers and developmental teams will not have an officer’s  most current input when trying to balance Air Force and career field requirements with the  officer’s desires.
A9.4.2.  Types of Development Plans to be Completed.  The officer has the option of selecting  from different purposes for completing a Development Plan.  The officer may complete a  Development Plan for assignment consideration, vectoring, command selection (if eligible)  and/or career broadening consideration.  Once the officer selects one or more purposes, the  document will be formatted to guide the officer through the completion of each applicable  section of the Development Plan.  The Assignment Preference section will allow the officer to  communicate their desires for the next 1 to 3 years.  The Development Preference section  permits the officer to define their career plans for the next 3 to 5 years and the next 5 to 10  years.  The Leadership Opportunities section allows the officer to communicate their desire to  be considered for command, and should only be completed if the officer is eligible.  The  Squadron Command eligibility criteria can be found on myFSS.  The Career Broadening  section allows the officer to volunteer for career broadening duties outside of their PAFSC  when available.  The Developmental Education section allows the officer to apply for IDE or  SDE, when the officer is eligible.  Remember, the Development Plan is not designed to create  the officer’s next assignment.  It is a tool that will be utilized to meet the development needs  of each officer and Air Force requirements.
A9.5.  Officer Departmental Special Duty Assignments.  The Air Force is tasked to fill high- level and highly sensitive officer departmental positions within the CONUS and overseas.  It is imperative, the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) should ensure all high level hiring  processes consist of slates with at least one underrepresented diverse candidate based on gender,  race and/or ethnicity.  Depending on the special duty activity, requirements fall into two  categories: select and assign or nominate and assign.  For select and assign requirements, the  AFPC officer assignment team will identify the best qualified officer that meets mandatory  requirements and processes assignment. (T-1) For nominate and assign positions, the AFPC  officer assignment team will identify the best qualified officer that meets mandatory  requirements and nominate the officer to the special duty activity for acceptability. (T-1)  Examples of officer special duties are:  Interservice and International Military Personnel  Exchange Program, Attaché, STARNOM/CAPNOM, Regional Affairs Specialist/Political  Affairs Specialist, White House/Presidential Support, USAF Academy Instructor Duty,  AFROTC Instructor Duty, Air University Instructor Duty, Recruiting Service, Special  Experience Exchange Duty, and Operational Exchange Program.
A9.5.1.  Nomination Process.  Departmental agencies/organizations will receive one  nomination per requirement to review and determine acceptability. (T-1) However,  STARNOM positions working directly for the President of the United States or Vice President  of the United States will receive two nominations per requirement. (T-1) Nomination packages  are not accomplished for select and assign positions; however, are required for nominative  positions. (T-1) The basic nomination package will contain:  nomination memo/email;  commander’s recommendation; SURF; and member’s last four Officer Performance Reports.  (T-1) Nomination package requirements can vary depending on needs of the special duty  activity and the AFPC officer assignment team.  If the special duty activity determines the   480  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  officer is not qualified the activity must provide, in writing, specific rationale for unsuitability.  (T-1) The AFPC officer assignment team will review rationale to determine officer’s release.   If justified, officer will be removed from nomination and an alternate officer will be nominated;  if officers are available.  If no officers are available that meet the mandatory qualifications,  requirement will be placed into the next Air Force Officer Assignment System assignment  cycle for fill action.
A9.5.2.  Advertisement.  Air Force Officer Assignment System uses the assignment  management system (AMS), memorandums, PA releases, and myFSS article to advertise  officer departmental special duty assignments.  Normally, unless requirement is short notice,  the majority of officer special duties are advertised on AMS during one of the three officer  assignment cycles (spring, summer and fall).  Similar to EQUAL-Plus, requirements advertise  the special qualifications an officer needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations,  reporting instructions, and POCs for additional information.
A9.5.3.  How to Apply.  Interested officers may volunteer by updating their Airman  Development Plan.  If the special duty is advertised by other means, the memorandum, PA  release, or email will provide specific instructions how to apply with appropriate POCs and  suspense dates.  Officers should always update their Airman Development Plan to reflect their  desires regardless how officer special duty was advertised.
A9.5.4.  The Air Force Officer Assignment System guide, located on myFSS under AMS,  provides in-depth details on the officer assignment system/process from start to finish.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  481  Attachment 10  SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT – EQUAL-PLUS (ENLISTED ONLY)
A10.1.  Special Duty Assignments.  There are certain requirements throughout the Air Force  which cannot be satisfied by normal allocation and assignment selection criteria because the duties  require members with unique qualifications.  The requirement for unique qualifications, especially  when combined with other non-standard considerations, may warrant implementation of any of a  variety of special manning procedures different from those used to satisfy the majority of Air Force  requirements.
A10.1.1.  Some agencies, MAJCOMs, organizations, departments, and activities have Special  Duty Assignments and are authorized to advertise Special Duty Assignment requirements on    EQUAL-Plus, and some may be authorized to receive applications from members.   Assignment instructions are provided upon approval of PCS by the assignment OPR.  For other  Special Duty Assignments, a formal routing application process is neither feasible nor  necessary.  Because of the large number of Special Duty Assignments, it is not economical or  feasible to publish and maintain a grade, AFSC, and location requirements list, mission  statements, base support information, etc.  Interested members may obtain such information  on their own from the base library, by personal correspondence to the activity, from the POC  listed in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement, the member and Family Readiness Center, from base  OPRs for a subject, and so on, to assist them in deciding whether or not to volunteer.  Members  volunteering for a specific Special Duty Assignment are considered only for the type of special  duty and locations requested unless contacted and they expand or change their preferences or  type of duty, or they are selected as a non-volunteer.  In addition to the minimum eligibility  criteria listed in paragraph A10.4, additional eligibility criteria for specific duties are listed in  the AFECD, Special Category Guide, Stabilized Tour Guide and EQUAL-Plus advertisement,  as applicable.  Waivers to eligibility criteria in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement, to volunteer  for Special Duty Assignment consideration, or actual PCS, may be requested from the  controlling command or activity for Special Duty Assignments or the assignment OPR.  After  selection for PCS, there may be other factors which could render a member ineligible or  unqualified for PCS.
A10.1.2.  Designation as a Special Duty Assignment, in itself, does NOT:
A10.1.2.1.  Increase the manning priority of an activity (that is, its entitlement to personnel  resources), or
A10.1.2.2.  Authorize a stabilized tour, or special category, or
A10.1.2.3.  Affect the responsibility of the assignment OPR to distribute and manage  personnel resources to best serve the overall needs of the Air Force.  While it is true  activities designated as Special Duty Assignments may have some similarities in manning  procedures, each special manning procedure is individually justified and approved as  essential.  Designation as a Special Duty Assignment does not result in automatic  implementation of a standard set of special manning procedures.
A10.1.3.  As with any PCS, a member's qualifications to perform the required duty is the  primary consideration.  Most Special Duty Assignment requirements are filled by eligible  volunteers and volunteers are preferred by most Special Duty Assignments.  There are few   482  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  duties for which being a volunteer is a mandatory prerequisite by law or other directive.  While  volunteer status is an important factor, it is not a substitute for meeting PCS eligibility criteria  (except when law or other directive requires a volunteer).  Assignment of qualified non- volunteers is sometimes necessary to avoid unfilled requirements in a Special Duty  Assignment.
A10.1.4.  Some MAJCOMs and organizations are authorized to initiate assignment  recommendations on members who have been nominated or applied for Special Duty  Assignments (example:  AETC for Instructors); however, the AFPC assignment OPR is the  final approval/disapproval authority of the PCS (example:  those requirements that an  application is required).  For other activities, the assignment OPR both identifies and selects  members for PCS to the Special Duty Assignment.
A10.1.5.  Management of stabilized tours is prescribed by paragraph 6.11 and the stabilized  tour guide that can be found in the myFSS website.
A10.1.6.  Activities authorized to requisition replacement personnel (that is, those not  automatically filled by either computer allocation or the assignment OPR), use either the  procedures below, EQUAL-Plus, and (or) those procedures agreed to when designated as a  Special Duty Assignment.  Departmental and joint activities work with the assignment OPR to  write requisitions for publication on EQUAL-Plus.  Requisitions show the identification data  of the incumbent and the reason for requisition, such as increase in authorization, incumbent  selected for reassignment, etc.
A10.1.6.1.  For minimum tour activities authorized Special Duty Assignment manning,  requisitions are submitted only when the incumbent is a known loss such as when selected  for PCS, approved retirement, etc.
A10.1.6.2.  For maximum tour activities, requisitions are submitted with the forecast loss  of the incumbent.  Requisitions for replacement personnel for CONUS activities or those  overseas are submitted to arrive not later than the 25th day of the 12th month before the  required reporting month (if qualification in a course of instruction for the special duty or  foreign language is necessary for the assignment, the length of the specific course should  be added to this submission requirement).
A10.1.7.  Whenever a member is relieved from a Special Duty Assignment for cause,  paragraph 6.12 applies to the curtailment of the stabilized tour, and paragraph 6.21, 6.45, and
A10.8 may also apply.
A10.1.8.  For members relieve of duty, refer to paragraph 3.21.
A10.1.9.  A Special Duty Assignment may require longer service retainability than required  for a non-Special Duty Assignment PCS.  If a member declines, the member remains eligible  for any PCS for which the member possesses sufficient retainability and may still be assigned  to the Special Duty Assignment if the longer service retainability requirement is appropriately  waived (see paragraph 4.6.6.).
A10.2.  EQUAL-Plus.  EQUAL-Plus supplements EQUAL.  It advertises requirements for  Special Duty Assignments, joint assignments, departmental assignments, short notice overseas  assignments, and all CMSgt assignments.  The listing is updated weekly and is available on  EQUAL-Plus through MyVector.  EQUAL-Plus advertises upcoming requirements, special   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  483  qualifications a member needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting  instructions, minimum/maximum tour information, and POCs for additional information.   Members volunteer by clicking the volunteer button in the advertisement.  In addition, some  Special Duty Assignments also require a hard copy application.  CMSgts volunteer for assignment  via email to their AF/A1LE assignment NCO.
A10.3.  Requesting EQUAL-Plus Advertisement.
A10.3.1.  The Special Duty Assignment unit or organization requests to advertise a unique  requirement through EQUAL-Plus by forwarding the request (with justification) to the AFPC  FAM NLT 9 months before the RNLTD.  The FAM reviews and validates the request.  If the  request is approved, it is advertised on EQUAL-Plus.  If the request is disapproved, it is  returned to the originator with disapproval reason.  If the requirement falls under AETC, Air  Forces Cyber, or Joint Staff, the request is sent to the MAJCOM/A1, HAF/A1, of JS/J1 for  review and validation.  If validated, the MAJCOM/A1/J1 sends the request to the FAM.
A10.3.2.  Units or organizations with authorizations requiring recurring advertising through  EQUAL-Plus not already approved, should submit their fully justified requests to the MFM of  their servicing MAJCOM.  After review and validation the request is sent to the AFPC FAM  for review and validation.  Since requests of this nature usually necessitate a manning point  change, the AFPC FAM must forward to AFPC/DP3AM for further processing and final  approval/disapproval.
A10.4.  Applying for a Special Duty Assignment.  Waivers to the following general criteria to  permit a member to volunteer for a Special Duty Assignment are not considered.  If it becomes  necessary to consider members for an assignment who do not meet the general minimum criteria,  AFPC/DP3AM (or the special duty activity when authorized by AFPC/DP3AM), stipulates the  criterion which does not have to be met and solicits volunteers or identifies non-volunteers for  possible assignment or actual PCS.  A member who does not meet the normal minimum general  criteria to volunteer for Special Duty Assignment consideration, but does meet the modified  criteria outlined in a solicitation message or EQUAL-Plus advertisement may volunteer at that  time, or could be selected as a non-volunteer when necessary.
A10.4.1.  Members are not eligible to be selected for a Special Duty Assignment if they:
A10.4.1.1.  Have any other self-initiated assignment programs request pending or  approved.  Members in the CONUS may volunteer for normal overseas assignment and  volunteer for a Special Duty Assignment at the same time via updating their preferences  through the vMPF.
A10.4.1.2.  Have an active UIF, are on the Control Roster, or other assignment quality  control reasons in paragraph 6.20.
A10.4.1.3.  Are not recommended by their commander.  The commander's unfavorable  recommendation indicates the member's past performance and other factors clearly show  the member cannot be expected to perform the duties of the Special Duty Assignment.       484  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024
A10.4.1.4.  Are requesting consideration for an AFPC, MAJCOM or organization  controlled Special Duty Assignment, and do not have an overall rating of at least V on their  last three EPRs/EPBs. There can be no unfavorable comments regarding the member's  personal qualities or conduct, working relations, job knowledge, personal appearance, or  duty performance within the EPRs/EPBs.
A10.4.1.5.  Are pipeline trainees (except the Security Forces Academy for duty with the  USAF Honor Guard, or when AFPC solicits trainee volunteers).  Course supervisor  recommendation is an acceptable substitute for EPR/EPB for pipeline trainees, but not  retrainees.
A10.4.2.  The following additional prerequisites also apply:
A10.4.2.1.  If members currently have an AAC listed in Table 3.1, then the Date of  Availability for reassignment cannot be more than 12 months from the date of application.
A10.4.2.2.  Members must possess a skill level commensurate with their grade. (T-1)
A10.4.2.3.  Members who possess a CONUS/overseas imbalanced AFSC are considered  for an Overseas Special Duty Assignment in only the imbalanced AFSC.
A10.4.2.4.  Members applying for duty in an SDI must be qualified for entry or award of  the SDI according to the AFECD or Air Force Officer Classification Directory or the  prescribing directive for the SDI. (T-1)
A10.4.2.5.  Selection for Special Duty Assignment is dependent on meeting required  eligibility criteria as specified in AFMAN 36-2100.  When volunteering for a Special Duty  Assignment, members must update their application through MyVector and submit a  formal application, if required. (T-1) The EQUAL-Plus advertisement and in some cases  the Special Category Guide, lists any unique application requirements.  Members may  submit applications for consideration for Special Duty Assignment as follows:
A10.4.2.5.1.  Members assigned overseas with an established DEROS can apply for  EQUAL-Plus ads if their DEROS coincides with the reporting date of the Special Duty  Assignment.  Requests to curtail the DEROS to make a member eligible is not  authorized.
A10.4.2.5.2.  Members assigned overseas with an indefinite DEROS can apply for  EQUAL-Plus ads provided the advertised RNLTD is after completion of the initial  prescribed tour.  If selected, a DEROS is established which is consistent with the  RNLTD of the Special Duty Assignment but not prior to what the DEROS is based on  the original tour.
A10.4.2.5.3.  Members serving a CONUS stabilized tour may apply for EQUAL-Plus  ads if their Date of Availability coincides with the reporting date of the Special Duty  Assignment.  Requests to curtail the Date of Availability to make a member eligible is  not authorized.
A10.4.2.5.4.  Members who desire to apply for an AFPC-controlled Special Duty  Assignment must meet the minimum eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A10.4, and  any additional eligibility criteria listed in the AFECD, Special Category Guide,  Stabilized Tour Guide, and EQUAL-Plus advertisement. (T-1) When an application for  Special Duty Assignment requires only an update in MyVector (no hard copy   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  485  application/documentation needed), the member’s volunteer status remains valid until  either selected for the Special Duty Assignment or volunteer status is changed.
A10.4.2.5.5.  Members assigned overseas or serving a CONUS Maximum Stabilized  Tour who have entered their overseas returnee/CMM Cycle and have an assignment  selection date, may apply for an EQUAL-Plus advertised job no later than the day  before the overseas returnee/CMM EQUAL is advertised.
A10.5.  Application Requirements for MAJCOM or Organization-Controlled Special  Duty.  Assignments.  The following is required in addition to volunteering via AMS:
A10.5.1.  The member provides any documentation required by the EQUAL-Plus  advertisement.
A10.5.2.  The application contains the specific job number reflected in the EQUAL-Plus  advertisement.
A10.5.3.  When photographs are submitted as part of the application process, write the name  and SSN (last 4) of the member on the reverse of the photograph with a permanent marker.
A10.5.4.  When an advertising unit/organization receives an application, they review for  eligibility of the requirements of the position.
A10.5.5.  The advertising unit/organization forwards the names of the members, in  alphabetical order, they received an application meeting the position requirements to the AFPC  assignment OPR.  The assignment OPR is the final approval/disapproval for all assignments.
A10.6.  Selection Priority for Overseas Locations.  The selection priority for EQUAL-Plus jobs  advertised for requirements at overseas locations is:
A10.6.1.  First:  Local overseas volunteers with at least 12 months left on DEROS and are able  to extend an additional 12 months.  (Local is defined as currently stationed at the same duty  location of EQUAL-Plus location.)
A10.6.2.  Second:  Short tour overseas returnee/COT volunteers with an established DEROS  (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-theater volunteers)
A10.6.3.  Third:  Long tour overseas returnee/COT volunteers with an established DEROS  (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-theater volunteers)
A10.6.4.  Fourth:  Short tour overseas returnee/COT volunteers with an indefinite DEROS  (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-theater volunteers)
A10.6.5.  Fifth:  Long tour overseas returnee/COT volunteers with an indefinite DEROS  (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-theater volunteers)
A10.6.6.  Sixth:  CMM volunteers prioritized by Date of Availability then date arrived station.
A10.6.7.  Seventh:  All other CONUS volunteers prioritized by date arrived station.
A10.6.8.  Eighth:  CONUS members who have an assignment preference updated for the  base/location of the EQUAL-Plus location prioritized by date arrived station.
A10.6.9.  Ninth:  CMM non-volunteers prioritized by Date of Availability then date arrived  station.
A10.6.10.  Tenth:  CONUS non-volunteers prioritized by date arrived station.   486  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024
A10.7.  Selection Priority for CONUS locations.  The selection priority for EQUAL-Plus jobs  advertised for requirements at CONUS locations is:
A10.7.1.  First:  Overseas short tour returnee volunteers with an established DEROS.
A10.7.2.  Second:  Overseas long tour returnee volunteers with an established DEROS.
A10.7.3.  Third:  Overseas short tour returnee volunteers with an indefinite DEROS and will  complete the prescribed overseas tour by the departure date.
A10.7.4.  Fourth:  Overseas long tour returnee volunteers with an indefinite DEROS and will  complete the prescribed overseas tour by the departure date.
A10.7.5.  Fifth:  CMM volunteers prioritized by Date of Availability then date arrived station.
A10.7.6.  Sixth:  CONUS local volunteers prioritized by least time-on-station.  A local  volunteer is a member who is currently stationed at the same duty location of EQUAL-Plus  advertisement location, who is not overseas vulnerable, and understands the reassignment will  be a No Cost PCA move; or is a member currently stationed in close proximity to the EQUAL- Plus advertisement location, who is not overseas vulnerable, and agrees to low-cost PCS.   Note:  Local volunteers require 12 months time-on-station as of departure date to be  considered.
A10.7.7.  Seventh:  All other CONUS volunteers prioritized by date arrived station.
A10.7.8.  Eighth:  CONUS members who have an assignment preference updated for the  base/location of the EQUAL-Plus location prioritized by date arrived station.
A10.7.9.  Ninth:  CMM non-volunteers prioritized by Date of Availability then date arrived  station.
A10.7.10.  Tenth:  CONUS non-volunteers prioritized by date arrived station.
A10.8.  Developmental Special Duty (DSD) Assignments.  The Air Force has identified DSD  Special Duty Identifiers (SDIs) as enlisted developmental positions due to their unique leadership  roles and the Airman’s responsibility to mentor and develop Airmen. To ensure the right Airmen  are selected and assigned to these positions, a nomination process was implemented by the Air  Force Chief of Staff and CMSgt of the AF. The process gives commanders, through their  respective MAJCOM, the authority to nominate their members and deliberately influence a  developmental career path.
A10.8.1.  Service members perform duties in DSD on a semi-permanent or permanent duty  basis. These duties are unrelated to any specific career field and do not provide a normal career  progression pattern.  Performance in these positions can range from three to four years.
A10.8.2.  DSD positions produce and develop the world’s greatest members through oversight  and leadership of multiple members; ensure the well-being of members and their families; and  represent the enlisted corps and Air Force on a national stage involving supervision and  mentorship of subordinates and peers.
A10.8.2.1.  The DSD SDIs are listed in the DSD PSD Guide:  Developmental Special Duty  (DSD) Program, located on myFSS.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  487
A10.8.2.1.1.  AF/A1 is the approval authority for adding or removing an SDI as a  Developmental Special Duty. Requests must be staffed from the Air Force Career Field  Manager for the SDI through AF/A1PP for assignment implications.
A10.8.3.  Eligibility Criteria. Commanders must ensure members are PCS eligible and meet  the minimum eligibility criteria for the nominated DSD position(s) as listed in the AFECD,  Special Category Guide, and Stabilized Tour Guide. (T-1)
A10.8.4.  Nomination Cycles. Nomination cycles occur bi-annually in spring and fall. During  each cycle, AFPC/DPMOS releases instructions in a PSD Memorandum to the MAJCOM/A1s.  The intent of the nominative process is for commanders to identify and nominate members  who have displayed the leadership skills capable to succeed in a DSD position. Nominations  should not be based solely on a member’s desire to fill a particular position.  Members are not  selected for positions outside commanders’ nomination.
A10.8.5.  Assignment Selection. Members must be nominated by their commander and  respective MAJCOM and meet ALL eligibility criteria for selection.  AFPC/DPMOS validates  eligibility of MAJCOM nominations prior to placing them on assignment. Members selected  and hired for CONUS DSD duty locations have an AAC 50 updated in MilPDS for the tour  length specified in the Stabilized Tour Guide.     488  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 11  VOLUNTARY STABILIZED BASE ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM (VSBAP) (REGAF  ENLISTED ONLY)
A11.1.  Purpose.  The policy in this Attachment applies to RegAF only and is not applicable to  USSF.  This program is intended to provide enlisted members a stabilized tour in exchange for  volunteering for an assignment to a historically hard to fill location.  The current locations used  for VSBAP are Cannon AFB, NM, Grand Forks AFB, ND, Minot AFB, ND, and Los Angeles  AFB, CA (including Fort MacArthur CA).  Upon approval, members assigned to Grand Forks or  Minot AFB will serve a 5-year stabilized tour while those assigned to Cannon AFB and Los  Angeles AFB (or Fort MacArthur) will serve a 4-year stabilized tour. (T-1)
A11.2.  VSBAP Eligibility.  Members must meet the below criteria to apply:
A11.2.1.  Have at least 3 years, 5 months’ time-on-station to apply and at least 4 years’ time- on-station before PCS departure if assigned in the CONUS (see paragraph A11.3.3 if  currently serving on a CONUS stabilized tour). (T-1)
A11.2.2.  Not have an assignment selection date. (T-1)
A11.2.3.  Not be in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, or 27 as listed in Table",

Members apply for VSBAP by filling out the application on the vMPF through the  self-service applications.\nA11.3.2.  Members assigned overseas may apply for VSBAP at the time of DEROS forecast.   Members assigned to a CONUS Maximum Stabilized Tour may apply for VSBAP at the time  of completing their Maximum Tour RIP.\nA11.3.3.  Members serving on a CONUS stabilized tour may apply no earlier than 7 months  before Date of Availability.  The Date of Availability would be the expiration date of the AAC  associated with the stabilized tour.  If the VSBAP application is approved, departure date is  after the stabilized tour Date of Availability.\nA11.3.4.  Members assigned to a VSBAP location (but not serving on a VSBAP) may apply  for an in-place VSBAP.  There is no time-on-station minimum to apply.  The deferment is  effective upon approval of the application.\nA11.3.5.  Members assigned to a VSBAP location (and serving a VSBAP) may not receive a  consecutive VSBAP at the same location.  They may apply for another VSBAP assignment to  a different location after completing 3 years, 5 months at 4 year locations or 4 years, 5 months  at 5 year locations of the current VSBAP assignment.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  489\nA11.3.6.  Career enlisted Airmen or Guardians serving on a VSBAP may apply for an in-place  Base of Preference 7 months before the end of their VSBAP provided they meet all eligibility  criteria as outlined in Attachment 2.  The Date of Availability for an in-place Base of  Preference is 2 years from the completion date of the VSBAP or from the date of approval  (whichever is later).  Note:  A second VSBAP following an in-place Base of Preference is not  authorized.\nA11.3.7.  Applications which cannot be immediately approved are continually considered for  6 months or until request is withdrawn by the member or the member becomes ineligible  through such action as selection for a PCS other than the VSBAP.\nA11.3.8.  Exceptions may be considered for an assignment in an awarded AFSC (other than  CAFSC) only when worldwide and local manning supports.\nA11.3.9.  Members who have their VSBAP application approved are ineligible to later apply  for a first-term base of preference assignment.  Exception:  This limitation does not apply to  first-term Airmen or Guardians retraining under Career Airmen Reenlistment Reservation  System who will attend a formal training course of over 20 weeks duration, or those who  cannot be used at their present base in the Career Airmen Reenlistment Reservation System  retraining AFSC.\nA11.4.  Canceling/Curtailing an Approved VSBAP.  A member may request cancellation of an  approved VSBAP assignment or curtailment of the 4-year or 5-year tour after completing 3 or 4  years on the VSBAP assignment.  Requests for cancellation should be fully justified, endorsed by  the commander, and forwarded through the MPF to the assignment OPR.     490  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 12  OVERSEAS TOUR EXTENSION INCENTIVE PROGRAM (OTEIP) (REGAF AND  USSF ENLISTED ONLY)\nA12.1.  Purpose.  To save PCS funds by providing specific incentives, as authorized by Congress  and the SecAF, to enlisted members in certain skills who extend their overseas tour for 12 months.\nA12.2.  Who is Eligible.  Members must meet the below criteria. (T-1):\nA12.2.1.  Be serving in either:\nA12.2.1.1.  A CAFSC/CSFSC designated by the SecAF that is:\nA12.2.1.1.1.  All five positions of DAFSC/DSFSC (skill level/suffix-specific) match  all five positions of the CAFSC/CSFSC (skill level/suffix-specific) on the OTEIP  listing and\nA12.2.1.1.2.  Members with prefixes to designated AFSC/SFSCs are eligible; however  only those suffixes indicated are eligible (if an AFSC/SFSC is indicated only with a  suffix then members possessing the AFSC/SFSC without that particular suffix are not  eligible), or\nA12.2.1.2.  Be serving at a short tour location (tour lengths of NA/12, 24/12, 24/15) where  all AFSC/SFSCs are eligible, and\nA12.2.2.  Extend their overseas tour for a period of 12 months (no more, no less), and\nA12.2.3.  Have or be eligible to obtain the required PCS retainability.\nA12.3.  Who is Not Eligible.\nA12.3.1.  Officers.\nA12.3.2.  Members who cannot obtain the required retainability.\nA12.3.3.  Members at long tour locations who do not hold a specific CAFSC/CSFSC  designated by the SecAF, or skill level, or suffix do not match designated CAFSC/CSFSC.\nA12.3.4.  Members who extend their DEROS for a period other than 12 months.\nA12.3.5.  Members whose DEROS is involuntarily extended (during the involuntary extension  period only).\nA12.3.6.  Members who have an indefinite DEROS (members with an indefinite DEROS must  first establish a DEROS 12 months from the current date and then, if otherwise eligible, request  an OTEIP extension). (T-1)\nA12.3.7.  Members who are required to serve or agree to serve a prescribed tour length or  period of time in conjunction with an action or program other than OTEIP are not eligible to  receive the OTEIP tour extension incentive for the same period. (T-1) Example:  a member  serving a 24 month unaccompanied tour who marries a civilian spouse and receives approval  of command sponsorship or receives a join spouse assignment is obligated to serve the  accompanied tour length.  The member would not be eligible for OTEIP for the period of time  necessary to support the accompanied tour length.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  491\nA12.4.  OTEIP Incentives/Restrictions.\nA12.4.1.  Eligible Members may elect one of the following incentive options:\nA12.4.1.1.  Y1 option: special pay of $2,000 lump sum.\nA12.4.1.2.  Y2 option: 30 days nonchargeable leave.\nA12.4.1.3.  Y3 option: 15 days nonchargeable leave and government funded round trip  transportation from the overseas location to the nearest CONUS port (travel provided for  the member only).\nA12.4.2.  Members electing the $2,000 lump sum incentive receive it once they enter the 12  month OTEIP extension.  If a member is curtailed before completing the entire extension  period, recoupment of the unearned portion of the incentive pay may be required as explained  in paragraph A12.6.\nA12.4.3.  Members electing either leave option (Y2 or Y3) must take the OTEIP leave  incentive within 6 months after entering the OTEIP extension. (T-1) Refer to AFI 36-3003 for  additional guidance on leave, transportation incentives, exceptions and expiration time frame.\nA12.4.4.  Once an OTEIP incentive has been approved, any request to change to a different  incentive requires full justification, to include commander\u2019s recommendation.  The same is  true if an election other than OTEIP was made, and the request is to change to OTEIP.  Submit  these type of requests and attach the original DEROS RIP by email to AFPC/DP3AM or  USSF/ETMO with an information copy to the assignment OPR.\nA12.5.  Application Procedures.\nA12.5.1.  Members who are OTEIP eligible apply for OTEIP at the time of DEROS forecasting  by using the DEROS RIP.  This RIP automatically reflects the OTEIP incentive options.  Note:   MPF should not request DEROS RIPs for OTEIP eligible members out-of-cycle (manually).   Manually requested DEROS RIPs do not pass the same PDS edits and do not reflect the OTEIP  options. The member and the Commander must sign the DEROS RIP and forward it to the  MPF within 30 days from the day it was produced. (T-1) The MPF must update and process  OTEIP requests through PDS. (T-1)\nA12.5.2.  Commanders and the assignment OPR evaluate each extension request and have  disapproval authority when such action is warranted (quality control, projected authorization  changes, projected over manning by grade and skill, etc.).\nA12.6.  Cancellation/Recoupment of OTEIP Incentives.  Temporary/Permanent Withdrawal of  AFSC/SFSC.  When members are removed from their incentive extension CAFSC/CSFSC and/or  DAFSC/DSFSC for cause or for other conditions over which they had control (as determined by  the commander) and used their incentive, the following apply:\nA12.6.1.  Recoupment of the unearned part of the incentive pay is taken based on a monthly  amount of $166.66, but the DEROS remains firm unless adjusted by AFPC/DP3AM or  USSF/ETMO.  Example:  a member serving an OTEIP extension until November 2011 has his  AFSC/SFSC withdrawn for cause in May 2011.  In this case, the DEROS will remain  November 2011 and the member will have $999.96 recouped from his monthly pay ($166.66  for each month (Jun - Nov) he does not serve in the OTEIP AFSC/SFSC).  The MPF must   492  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  immediately notify AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO via CMS, of the OTEIP AFSC/SFSC  withdrawal action, so recoupment action can be initiated through DFAS. (T-1)\nA12.6.2.  Nonchargeable leave and/or transportation incentives used are charged to the  member.  DEROS remains firm unless adjusted by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.\nA12.6.3.  Members  removed  from  their  incentive  extension  CAFSC/CSFSC  or  DAFSC/DSFSC for reasons other than for cause or conditions over which they had no control  (as determined by the commander), are not usually charged for used leave and transportation  costs.  Members who elected the monetary incentive have the unearned portion recouped per  paragraph A12.6.1.  In all cases, the DEROS remains firm unless adjusted by AFPC/DP3AM  or USSF/ETMO.  Note:  All members are expected to perform duty in the incentive extension  AFSC/SFSC for the complete period of the extension.  Any TDY outside the CAFSC/CSFSC  as ordered by the commander must first be approved by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO. (T-1)\nA12.6.4.  Incentive benefits are not cancelled or recouped for those members promoted to a  grade that results in a mandatory skill level change which may remove them from the OTEIP  AFSC/SFSC eligibility list.\nA12.7.  Mandatory PCS.  When members are in a mandatory PCS, the following apply:\nA12.7.1.  When a member has entered the 12-month OTEIP extension and is curtailed due to  mission requirements or humanitarian reasons (mandatory PCS), any incentives already  received/used are not normally recouped; however, all unused incentives terminate upon  departure from the current station.  AFPC/DP3AM or ETMO is the final approval authority  for determining if the member has to repay the government for any unearned incentives.\nA12.7.2.  When a member with an approved OTEIP extension has not entered their extension  and due to force structure changes, or other mission reasons, the OTEIP extension can no  longer be supported, the extension reverts to a normal extension.  The member may then  request to reinstate their original DEROS or establish an earlier DEROS which includes the  reverted normal extension.\nA12.7.3.  Once a force structure change is announced, mission changes may preclude a  member\u2019s use of OTEIP transportation and leave options.  When this occurs, members may  request, with commander's concurrence, to change their OTEIP incentive to Y1.  Such requests  are submitted by the member to the MPF, to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO via CMS. If an  announced closure/inactivation date is subsequently delayed, members who were OTEIP  eligible but were unable to extend the full 12 months (based on the initially announced  closure/inactivation date) who will now be able to complete a 12-month extension, may request  OTEIP option Y1 as an exception to policy. (T-1) This exception request may be processed  even though the member may have already served a portion of the extension that makes up the  12-month period.  Members in this situation are not authorized to apply for options Y2 or Y3.   These exception requests are submitted through the MPF to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO  for a final decision.  Requests include specific start and stop dates which clearly show the  member can complete the required 12-month extension period.       DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  493\nA12.8.  Command Sponsorship.  Members initially serving an unaccompanied tour who elect  and have entered an OTEIP extension and subsequently acquire dependents and apply for  command sponsorship keep their OTEIP entitlement.  However, members initially serving an  unaccompanied tour who elect and have NOT entered an OTEIP at the time of acquiring  dependents and applying for command sponsorship, the OTEIP is canceled (see paragraph\n7.11.2.13) but are still required to extend to fulfil the requirement to serve the equivalent of the  accompanied tour length for approval of command sponsorship.\nA12.9.  Cancellation Requests.  Members with approved OTEIP extensions may apply for  cancellation of all or part of the extension prior to entering the extension when unique situations  apply.  If approved, all OTEIP entitlements are lost upon approval of the cancellation request,  whether the extension was canceled in full or in part.  Requests for cancellation of OTEIP  extensions after entry are normally disapproved unless extreme circumstances warrant the  curtailment.  These circumstances include humanitarian or EFMP conditions or mission changes  that prevent completion of the extension.  Requests for cancellation after entry is processed and  approved by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO and indicate what incentive benefits have been used  or received by the member.  If a cancellation request is approved, recoupment of the unearned  portion of the $2,000 lump sum or leave/transportation incentive is completed as outlined in  paragraphs A12.6.1 and A12.6.2.     494  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 13  ENLISTED QUARTERLY ASSIGNMENTS LISTING (EQUAL) AND CONUS  MANDATORY MOVER (CMM) (REGAF ONLY)\nA13.1.  General Information.  The policy in this Attachment applies to RegAF only and is not  applicable to USSF.\nA13.2.  What is the EQUAL?  The EQUAL listing advertises those enlisted (SMSgt and below)  requirements (assignments) AFPC intends to make to and from overseas.  It shows what is  available by AFSC, grade, and location, and allows members the opportunity to align preferences  to actual Air Force needs.  Members can review the EQUAL on the AMS web page.\nA13.3.  When the EQUAL is not used.  The EQUAL is not used to advertise special duty,  joint/departmental, short notice overseas requirements, CONUS to CONUS moves, CMSgt  requirements, or aircrew assignment that involve either training or military couples returning from  overseas who desire join spouse assignment.  The EQUAL-Plus is used in these instances.\nA13.4.  How the EQUAL works.  Assignments to and from overseas are worked in three month  cycles as shown in Table A13.1 and Table A13.2.  Using the selection criteria and priority  provided in this instruction, assignments are matched eight times a year, four cycles each going to  and returning from overseas and CMM.  CMM are those members with a Maximum Stabilized  Tour deferment (AAC 50) whose codes are expiring and are considered \u201cmandatory movers.\u201d\nA13.4.1.  The CONUS to overseas cycle is the first step in the assignment process.  Generally,  overseas requirements (the number of positions to be filled) are determined based on the  number of members currently overseas who have a DEROS falling within a given cycle who  are returning to the CONUS.  AFPC/DPM uses this information to identify and advertise  overseas requirements on the EQUAL, allow members to volunteer for, and finally, select  members for overseas assignments.\nA13.4.2.  Once the overseas assignments have been matched to members, AFPC/DPM then  works to identify those CONUS locations where manning requirements exist.  There is one  CONUS requirement identified for each overseas returnee and CMM.  These requirements are  then advertised on the overseas returnee/CMM EQUAL.  Members prioritize and update  preferences based on the advertised requirements.\nA13.4.3.  The requirements are matched to the overseas returnee or CMM members.  This first  step is to match enlisted members with awarded SEIs against allocations with SEI  requirements, while satisfying the enlisted member\u2019s preferences.  The second step is an  attempt to match SEI requirements while ignoring preferences.  The third step is an attempt to  match preferences.  If neither an SEI match nor a preference match can be made, members are  matched to CONUS assignments based on AFSC, grade, and skill level.\nA13.5.  How to Use the EQUAL.\nA13.5.1.  Review the overseas EQUAL to see what overseas assignments are being filled.   Using that information, members can volunteer for up to eight preferences, using either  individual base codes or country codes from the advertised requirements.  However, listing a  specific base limits selection as a volunteer to just that base.  Example:  if the EQUAL lists a  requirement in a member\u2019s AFSC and grade at both Ramstein AB and Spangdahlem AB, the   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  495  member can volunteer for both by listing each separately or by just listing Germany as an  overseas preference.  However, if the member lists only Ramstein AB as a preference and not  Germany, AFPC/DPM does not consider them for voluntary assignment to Spangdahlem AB.   If more than one advertised EQUAL requirement is listed, all preferences are considered  equally for assignment purposes.  Provided members are eligible, selections are made  according to the priorities listed in Table 4.2 and Table 6.9.\nA13.5.2.  Overseas returnees and CMM should use the overseas returnee/CMM EQUAL to  align their CONUS assignment preferences to those locations listed (military couples see  paragraph A13.6.).  It's understood that the requirements advertised may not be true \"personal  assignment preferences,\" as the EQUAL only reflects those assignments which are being  matched.  However, ignoring or failing to prioritize the advertised requirements means  members receive the remaining assignment after all those who aligned and provided  preferences from the EQUAL are matched (regardless of a member\u2019s return priority).   Overseas returnees and CMM must read the overseas returnee/CMM Counseling Handout PSD  Guide during their DEROS option window or tour completion decision window.  The MPF  forwards the PSD Guide along with their DEROS Option RIP or Tour Completion RIP to each  member in accordance with the PSD Guide.  The PSD guide serves as the initial assignment  counseling for enlisted members (SMSgt and below) and provides options, specified timelines  and the repercussions for failure to act on certain personnel actions.  The minimum assignment  counseling requirements are satisfied when the MPF provides the member a copy of the  overseas returnee/CMM counseling handout.  If additional counseling is not requested, and the  member has initialed the portion of their RIP indicating they have read and understood the  overseas returnee/CMM counseling handout and the options available, then it is assumed they  will comply with the specified timelines and required personnel actions.  Receipt of the  handout constitutes formal assignment counseling.\nA13.6.  Military Couples, Join Spouse, and EQUAL.  (Also refer to paragraph 1.2.14.).\nA13.6.1.  Military couples who desire to be assigned together overseas (join spouse intent  codes \"A\" or \"B\") where an accompanied tour is authorized use the overseas EQUAL to  volunteer for overseas assignments.  Military couples will be provided a join spouse  assignment based on a requirement existing for both members.  If either member is selected as  the most eligible volunteer, the spouse receives join spouse consideration based on manning  over the next 6-month period from the RNLTD of the selected member.  Approval is based on  requirements versus vacancies.  Upon approval, and provided the join spouse meets all other  PCS criteria, the join spouse assignment is updated with the same RNLTD as the selected  member.\nA13.6.2.  Military couples who desire to be assigned together in the CONUS (with intent codes  \"A\" or \"B\") who are overseas returnees or CMM do not use the overseas returnee/CMM  EQUAL as CONUS requirements for military couples are not advertised.  Because of the  unique grade and AFSC make up of military couples, these assignments are hand-matched.   Military couples should maintain matching and current CONUS preferences which are  considered during their assignment match.  Preferences along with current Air Force needs are  used to determine join spouse assignment approval.\nA13.6.3.  Military couples who do not desire to be assigned together, or when a member of the  military couple has an approved retirement or separation (with intent code \u201cH\u201d), may   496  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  participate in the overseas returnee/CMM EQUAL cycle, provided their intent code of \u201cH\u201d  was in PDS prior to their assignment selection date.  If either member changes their join spouse  intent code to \u201cH,\u201d a join spouse assignment is not considered.  If selected for an assignment  and the member\u2019s intent code is \u201cH\u201d and later desires a join spouse assignment, the member  cannot have a join spouse move to that location at a later time unless the member is eligible  under some other assignment program.

Purpose.  The 365-Day extended deployment Advance Assignment/Assignment  Deferment Program was established to provide incentives for members to volunteer for 365-Day  extended deployments and provide more stability for families of deployed members.\nA14.2.  Eligibility Criteria.\nA14.2.1.  All members selected for a 365-Day extended deployment are authorized to apply  for an advanced assignment or a 24 month assignment deferment.  Assignment teams will work  to approve all requests (either advance assignment or assignment deferment) where there is a  valid entitlement, as an incentive to recruit more volunteers; however, final approval will be  based on best interests of the Air Force or Space Force and mission needs.  Waivers or  exceptions to policy will be processed in accordance with 365-Day extended deployment PSD  Guide.\nA14.2.2.  Volunteer members approved for an advanced assignment must have at least 24  months\u2019 time on station as of the projected Required Delivery Date to be eligible and must  have at least 36 months time on station before PCS departure and have the retainability for the  advanced assignment upon return from the TDY.\nA14.2.3.  Non-volunteer members selected for a 365-Day extended deployment do not have to  meet the 24 month time on station requirement to be eligible for an advanced assignment or  assignment deferment, however they still need to meet the 12 month time on station  requirement for 365-day extended deployment selection and have the retainability for the  advanced assignment if that is what they choose.\nA14.2.4.  Members make only make one election, either an advanced assignment or a 2-year  assignment deferment. Once the election is submitted, it constitutes the member\u2019s preference  and will not be reconsidered at a later date.  If the member desires a change, the only option  available is to request cancellation of such action, return to home station and enter the next  assignment cycle for which they are eligible.\nA14.3.  Incentives.\nA14.3.1.  Members can select an advance assignment with a Report Not Later Than Date  (RNLTD) NET 60 Days following return from their deployment, in order to allow time for  reconstitution and out-processing,  Advance Assignments can be approved No Earlier Than  (NET) 16 months from projected RNLTD.  PCS orders may be published immediately  following completion of all mandatory Permanent Change of Station actions to facilitate early  move of dependents to the advance assignment location.\nA14.3.2.  Once an members receives their advanced assignment, and provided they meet all  the outprocessing actions required in DAFMAN 36-2102, they can apply to get their PCS  orders published up to 16 months prior to their projected RNLTD and move their dependents  to their advanced assignment location prior to their deployment, in accordance with Permanent  Change of Station (PCS) Orders Processing PSD Guide located in myFSS.   498  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA14.3.3.  Members electing an overseas Advance Assignment that desire to send their  dependents in advance must also comply with DAFI 36-3012, Military Entitlements and  Military Entitlements PSD Guide.  Dependent travel to a designated place must be approved  prior to any movement of dependents.\nA14.4.  Basic Allowance for Housing Waivers.  Basic allowance for housing waivers may be  requested.  Execution guidance regarding the Secretarial Housing Waiver is located in myFSS.\nA14.5.  Deployed Members with an Advanced Assignment.  For members that are deployed  and have received an advanced assignment have the option to PCS directly to their new Permanent  Duty Station (PDS) rather than returning to their current duty station.  Applications must be in  writing to AFPC/DP3AM, 365-Day extended deployments Policy, through their unit  commander/equivalent, and home station MPF chief/equivalent.  Procedures for applying are in  accordance with the 365-Day Extended Deployment PSD Guide.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  499  Attachment 15  HUMANITARIAN REASSIGNMENT AND DEFERMENT (REGAF AND USSF ONLY)\nA15.1.  Spirit and Intent of the Humanitarian Program.  The Humanitarian Program was  established to assist members in resolving severe short-term problems involving a family member.   Members must be effectively utilized in their duty (officer) or control (enlisted) AFSC/SFSC.  When a request involves reassignment, it will normally be to the closest location to where the  family member concerned residence is so the member can provide the family member maximum  support, consistent with the manning needs of the DAF.  As a general rule, reassignment into a  special duty position is not considered since the selection process for such duties can be quite  involved and often requires an application to the \u201chiring authority.\u201d  Also, utilization in a special  duty position is not considered due to the lack of training capability.\nA15.2.  Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Guidance.\nA15.2.1.  Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of Assignment authority of  AFPC/DPFXAA.\nA15.2.2.  The Comptroller General has ruled that the move of Air Force members from one  place to another may not be made at government expense based solely on humanitarian  reasons.  The determining factor in the approval of a request for reassignment is the needs of  the DAF.\nA15.2.3.  A request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment is considered based on  individual merit taking into account the human factors involved, the member\u2019s skills and length  of service, and manning priorities and requirements.  A request may be approved when it is  clearly in the best interest of the DAF.\nA15.2.4.  A request for humanitarian reassignment may warrant giving assignment preference  to the member based on the facts presented.  The fact that the move would increase the morale  and effectiveness of the member may be considered in authorizing PCS in these circumstances,  but assignment on this fact alone is not authorized.\nA15.2.5.  The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned.   A request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted, except for  cases noted in paragraph A15.7.6 and A15.7.7.2. (T-3)\nA15.2.6.  Emergency or ordinary leave is to be used first as a means of easing family hardships  or problems before applying for humanitarian reassignment.\nA15.2.7.  All members must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever  called upon to do so.  The DAF is also committed to equal distribution of overseas assignments.   Therefore, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be considered.  If a  reassignment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the member must thereafter revert  to worldwide assignable status.\nA15.2.8.  A humanitarian request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved  based solely on the member\u2019s substandard performance and (or) conduct.  Members will only  be delayed from departing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of  investigation and trial by US military or civil authorities, or for administrative actions under  the UCMJ or DAFI 36-3211.  When a reassignment request has been approved and   500  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  administrative separation is not deemed appropriate, the losing commander must formally  notify the gaining commander, in writing, of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary  actions and provide a comprehensive analysis of the member\u2019s job related or personal  problems. (T-3)\nA15.2.9.  A humanitarian reassignment or deferment is normally a one-time action to solve a  problem within a reasonable period of time.\nA15.2.10.  For colonels and below and CMSgts and below (except those attending initial  technical training), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting  documentation to AFPC/DPFXAA.  For USAF colonels (including selectees) and CMSgts  (including selectees) while requests are submitted initially to AFPC, the final approval  authority is AF/A1LO and AF/A1LE, respectively.  For USSF colonels, colonel selects,  CMSgts, CMSgt selects, SMSgts, and SMSgt selects, while requests are submitted initially to  AFPC, the final approval authority is SF/S1L.  Requests will be provided to the appropriate  OPR for consideration once the required medical or legal review is obtained.  Throughout this  attachment when AFPC/DPFXAA is referred to, substitute AF/A1LO if the applicant is a  USAF colonel or colonel selectee; AF/A1LE if the applicant is a USAF CMSgt or CMSgt  selectee; and SF/S1L if the applicant is a USSF colonel, colonel select, CMSgt, CMSgt select,  SMSgt, or SMSgt select.  For Reserve members submit requests to ARPC/DPA and for ANG  members submit requests to NGB/A1PP.\nA15.3.  Terms (For the Purpose of Humanitarian Consideration).\nA15.3.1.  Family Member: Limited to spouse, child, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in- law, stepparent, person in loco parentis, or other persons actually residing in the household  who are dependent for over half of their financial support.  While siblings (brothers and sisters  of the member or spouse) are not within the definition of family member, requests involving  the terminal illness of a sibling may be forwarded for consideration as an exception to policy.\nA15.3.2.  Person in Loco Parentis: Refers to one who exercised parental rights, duties, and  responsibilities and, in fact, raised a member or spouse for a minimum of 5 years in place of a  mother or father because of death of the parent, or in the parent\u2019s continued absence from the  home before the member\u2019s or spouse\u2019s 21st birthday, or before the member\u2019s entry to the active  component, whichever is earlier.  The relationship must have been such that the member or  spouse looked upon the person as a parent, not merely as a temporary guardian.  The mere  presence of a person in the home for a number of years, during which time they exercised a  degree of custodial, but not parental responsibility, does not constitute in loco parentis.  Also,  in order for the child to have been in the care and control of one acting in place of the parent,  the parent cannot have resided in the same home (unless the parent was determined by a court  to lack decision-making capacity or pose a threat to self or others).\nA15.3.2.1.  A request based on in loco parentis status must include affidavits from all  parties (to include other family members, neighbors, clergy, or family friends) involved  stating the details of the custody, control, care, and management of the member or their  spouse.  In addition, submit copies of any documents that may have been created at the  time in loco parentis status was established relating to the custody, control, care, and  management of the member or spouse (court documents, tax returns, report cards signed  by the in loco parentis \u201cparent,\u201d etc.)   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  501\nA15.4.  Identifying and Reporting Humanitarian Conditions.\nA15.4.1.  A member desiring humanitarian deferment must submit their request through vMPF  within 30 calendar days from PCS notification, nomination for reassignment, or selection for  TDY in excess of 30 calendar days. (T-3)\nA15.4.2.  Should humanitarian conditions arise after PCS notification or other event  notification, but before departure, the member must submit their request to AFPC/DPFXAA  for consideration within 30 calendar days of learning of the condition (or a diagnosis). (T-3)\nA15.4.3.  If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, or a  reassignment has been approved but the member has not departed, the member must notify  their MPF.  An approved humanitarian reassignment is normally canceled if the situation for  which granted ceases to exist before the member\u2019s departure.  In this instance, the member can  request for the assignment not to be canceled, but must provide supporting documentation to  show what out-processing actions have been taken and the hardship they would incur if  canceled.  The MPF will provide this information to AFPC/DPFXAA who will make the final  decision and provide a response by email message. (T-3)\nA15.4.4.  Member must notify the MPF when the humanitarian condition ceases to exist for  removal from the program.  Once notified the MPF deletes the AAC and deployment  availability code.\nA15.5.  Basic Eligibility Criteria for Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment.  The following  basic criteria must be met before a request can be approved.\nA15.5.1.  A vacancy must exist at the new duty station if a PCS is involved and the member  must meet service retainability requirements for PCS. (T-1)\nA15.5.2.  The member must be experiencing a problem involving a family member (as defined  in paragraphs A15.3.1 and A15.3.2) that is more severe than usually encountered by other  members with a similar problem.\nA15.5.2.1.  Reassignment requests in which the Special Needs Coordinator at the local  military treatment facility (MTF) determines that adequate facilities or resources do not  exist and cannot be reasonably provided within the current assignment locale, are processed  under the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP).  The EFMP and Humanitarian  programs are not interchangeable (see paragraph 3.18 for EFMP guidance).\nA15.5.3.  The member\u2019s presence must be absolutely essential to alleviate the problem.\nA15.5.4.  The problem can be resolved within a reasonable period of time (normally 12  months).\nA15.6.  Assignment Considerations for Members with Humanitarian Conditions.\nA15.6.1.  A member stationed overseas and requesting reassignment overseas must agree to  serve the prescribed tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the  combined unaccompanied tour lengths at the old and new locations, whichever is greater.   Example:  if a member is serving on a 30/18-month overseas tour and receives approval for  reassignment to a 36/24-month overseas tour, the member must serve the full prescribed tour  at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined  unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two overseas locations   502  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater.  The computation resulting in the  greatest combined overseas tour period being served is the required minimum.  The variable is  the amount of time the member has been assigned to the current location.\nA15.6.2.  For members enroute PCS or TDY, the member may discuss the problem with the  nearest MPF Chief, AFPC/DPFXAA, or their Assignment authority to assist in deciding  whether or not to submit a request.  There is no reimbursement authorized if the member  decides to travel to the nearest base with an MPF and the member's status remains unchanged  (Example:  leave) if the member decides to submit a request.  The member must comply with  current reporting instructions if the Assignment authority denies suspension of movement;  however, a request still can be submitted.\nA15.6.3.  If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member\u2019s  foreign-born spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included  in the humanitarian request.  If reassignment is approved, a request for a designated location  move to the native country must be processed per DAFI 36-3012.\nA15.7.  Humanitarian Conditions Usually Warranting Approval.  It is impractical to try to list  all the conditions for which a humanitarian reassignment or deferment may be approved.  The  factors to be considered vary from case to case and the number of possible situations and  circumstances are almost infinite.  However, requests substantiating problems arising from any of  the following circumstances usually warrant approval:\nA15.7.1.  The recent death (within 12 months) of the member\u2019s spouse or child, including  miscarriages of 20 weeks or more gestation.  Humanitarian reassignment is normally approved  on the death of a child or stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in the member\u2019s home at  the time of death.  A request based on a child or stepchild who is over the age of 18 will be  considered on a case-by-case basis.  Reassignment made under this provision will normally be  considered to only one of two locations, either near extended family for support or to the closest  available base to the burial site.\nA15.7.2.  The member has a serious financial problem not the result of overextension of  personal military income (such as loss of primary home of residence where the member or  spouse and children currently reside, or loss of possessions through fire, theft, or natural  disaster), and the member will suffer a substantial financial loss unless their presence or  continued presence can be ensured.  It must be shown that the problem cannot be resolved by  leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or by any other person or means.\nA15.7.3.  The member is serving an unaccompanied overseas tour and their spouse abandons  their children.  It must be shown it is not possible for the children to join the member at the  overseas location when an accompanied tour is authorized and that the member\u2019s presence is  necessary.\nA15.7.4.  The terminal illness of a family member (as defined in paragraph A15.3.1 and\nA15.3.2) when death is imminent within 2 years.  A doctor's prognosis of a terminal illness  must be fully supported and substantiated by clinical data.  In such cases, the member\u2019s  presence is considered essential regardless of the availability of other family members to assist.\nA15.7.5.  An authorized state or local agency places a child in the member\u2019s home and  deferment is necessary to comply with state or local laws to complete final adoption.   Reassignment to pursue adoption is not normally authorized.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  503\nA15.7.6.  Reassignment or deferment is essential in establishing or operating an effective  family advocacy program according to DAFI 40-301.  Documentation from the base Family  Advocacy Officer is required.  Note:  While requests for humanitarian consideration must be initiated by the member, there are  some instances involving family advocacy issues where the member does not desire assignment  or assignment cancellation and there are no quality control factors that would support such  action.  In these situations, the member\u2019s commander can request assignment or assignment  cancellation via humanitarian deferment when the basis is to continue or obtain treatment for  family advocacy issues.  The request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family  Advocacy Officer (see paragraph 7.5.9.2 for members assigned overseas).\nA15.7.7.  Reassignment requests due to a member\u2019s spouse or child who was sexually  assaulted will be considered for approval by AFPC/DPFXAA when paragraph A15.7.7.2  does not apply.  The request for reassignment must be fully substantiated by the appropriate  medical authority that remaining in the area where the incident occurred would be detrimental  to the welfare of the family member.\nA15.7.7.1.  Members may request a specific base for reassignment following a sexual  assault incident involving the spouse or child; however, manning must fully support the  member's desired location.  The primary consideration is to relocate the member\u2019s family  away from where the incident occurred.  Retraining may be considered for this type of  request on a case-by-case basis.\nA15.7.7.2.  If the sexual assault occurred within the family or with an intimate partner,  reassignment requests will be under the Humanitarian Assignments program when it is  essential in establishing or operating an effective Family Advocacy program according to  DAFI 40-301.  The Family Advocacy Program, consistent with DoDI 6400.06, covers adult  military dependent sexual assault victims who are assaulted by a spouse or intimate partner  and military dependent sexual assault victims who are 17 years of age and younger.  The  installation Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Coordinator, Family Advocacy  Program and domestic violence intervention and prevention staff shall direct coordination  when a sexual assault occurs within a domestic relationship or involves child abuse.  Note:  While requests for humanitarian consideration must  be initiated by the member, there are  some instances involving family advocacy issues where the member does not desire assignment  or assignment cancellation and there are no quality control factors that would support such  action.  In these situations, the member\u2019s commander can request assignment or assignment  cancellation via humanitarian deferment when the basis is to continue or obtain treatment for  family advocacy issues.  The request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family  Advocacy Officer (see paragraph 7.5.9.2 for personnel assigned overseas). (T-3)\nA15.8.  Reasons Humanitarian Requests are Usually Disapproved.  Requests for reassignment  or deferment are usually disapproved when it is probable that the problem will exist for an  indefinite period of time, or the request is based on one of the following circumstances:\nA15.8.1.  A desire to provide physical, emotional, or other support to help with the activities  of daily living to a parent or parent-in-law due to age, non-terminal or chronic illness or  disability, or recent death in the family.   504  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA15.8.2.  Problems associated with child care arrangements, or a single parent\u2019s desire to make  or facilitate either short or long term child care arrangements.\nA15.8.3.  Psychoneurosis (such as various psychic or mental disorders characterized by special  combinations of anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory  manifestations) resulting from family separation incident to military assignment.\nA15.8.4.  Normal pregnancy, threatened miscarriage, breech birth, Cesarean section, or RH  incompatibility.\nA15.8.5.  The existence of a housing shortage or home ownership problems.\nA15.8.6.  A financial problem, to include bankruptcy, resulting from over-extension of  military income.\nA15.8.7.  A financial or management problem related to off-duty employment, the spouse\u2019s  employment, private business activities, or to settle an estate.\nA15.8.8.  Passport or visa problems involving newly acquired family members.\nA15.8.9.  Threatened separation, divorce action, or the desire to pursue child custody.\nA15.8.10.  The problem existed or was reasonably foreseeable at the time of latest entry on  active component without a break in service, or prior to departure on PCS.\nA15.8.11.  For the purpose of seeking or providing family support except as outlined in  paragraphs A15.7.1 or A15.7.7.1.\nA15.8.12.  A consecutive PCS or deferment based on continuation of the same circumstances  (does not include a request to extend a current deferment--see paragraph A15.12.).\nA15.8.13.  A request based on the medical condition of the member. (Assignment for this  reason is initiated by local medical authorities and AFPC/DPMNR when it is determined the  situation warrants such action.)\nA15.8.14.  Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been  selected and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days.  A deferment request for  an officer can be considered based on the member\u2019s appearance on the VML if coordination  with the assignment OPR confirms assignment selection is highly likely.\nA15.9.  Processing Humanitarian Requests.  Requests must be submitted via vMPF in  accordance with PSD Guide-Voluntary Assignments:  Humanitarian Reassignment and Deferment  Program Reassignment that are located on myFSS. (T-3)\nA15.9.1.  A member desiring humanitarian reassignment who also has a spouse or child(ren)  enrolled in the EFMP must complete the myVector FMTS application. A humanitarian  reassignment cannot be approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the needs  of the exceptional family member.\nA15.9.2.  When a member is married to another member and desires join spouse consideration,  a join spouse intent letter must accompany the member\u2019s application in order for the military  spouse to also be considered for assignment action.\nA15.9.3.  The final approval/disapproval authority is AFPC/DPFXXA.  A request cannot be  approved or denied at a lower level.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  505\nA15.10.  Available Options When a Request is Disapproved.  When a request is disapproved  the MPF must counsel the member on the following options:  Member may apply (if eligible) for  retirement, retirement under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation  or release from the active component.  For those who are pending reassignment a request under  this paragraph must be submitted within 7 calendar days following receipt of the correspondence  disapproving the request. (T-3)\nA15.11.  Withdrawing a Request.  If a member wants to withdraw their request before a final  decision or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the MPF  or AFPC/DPFXAA immediately.  Once a member has departed on a humanitarian reassignment,  the request can no longer be withdrawn. (T-3)\nA15.12.  Humanitarian Assignment/TDY Restrictions.  The TDY assignment authority will not  select a member for TDY exceeding 30 calendar days while in humanitarian deferment (AAC 30).   If provided a humanitarian reassignment, members will not be reassigned PCS for at least 12  months from date arrived station.  A deferment will initially restrict members from PCS or TDY  for a maximum of 12 months.  The initial period of assignment/TDY restriction for humanitarian  reasons may be extended at the member\u2019s request provided the total period does not exceed 18  months.  If a terminal illness is involved, deferment may be extended up to a total of 24 months.  (T-3)\nA15.12.1.  Requests for such extensions must substantiate that:\nA15.12.1.1.  Every possible effort has been made to overcome the problem.\nA15.12.1.2.  The condition warranting assignment/TDY restriction still exists.\nA15.12.1.3.  The problem can be resolved within the extended period of assignment/TDY  restriction.\nA15.12.2.  If a member\u2019s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of  the assignment restriction, the member is considered for intra-command reassignment to  another organization on the same base.  If no authorization for their specialty exists on base,  or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by  AFPC/DPFXAA.     506  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Attachment 16  ASSIGNMENT OF NON-PRIOR SERVICE PIPELINE STUDENTS (REGAF AND USSF  ENLISTED ONLY)\nA16.1.  AFPC/DPMLW Technical Training Graduates (TTG) Assignments Section  Processing and Procedures Responsibilities.\nA16.1.1.  Distributes available TTGs to the MAJCOMs on an equal basis by matching TTGs  to their end assignment and providing instructions to the Total Force Service Center through  either the PDS or by email.  projected departure date and RNLTD are based upon graduation  date plus 30 days for CONUS assignments and graduation date plus 45 days for overseas  assignments.\nA16.1.1.1.  A member\u2019s port call may be earlier than the RNLTD month as determined by  the actual departure date, and leave and travel time authorized.  This will preclude a  requirement to request a change to the RNLTD and member to not use more leave than  desired.  Under such circumstances, reporting overseas prior to the RNLTD month will not  result in a Category 1 PCS Processing Discrepancy.\nA16.1.1.2.  Assignment selection criteria for CONUS and overseas volunteers.  Members  who are volunteers for CONUS or overseas locations as recorded on their assignment  preferences in vMPF are matched to overseas short/dependent-restricted overseas  requirements first, then standard accompanied overseas requirements second, then CONUS  requirements and arranged in order of grade (highest grade takes precedence), DOR  (earliest date takes precedence), TAFMSD (earliest date takes precedence), date of birth  (DOB) (earliest date takes precedence) and then, if necessary, in reverse SSN order (use  all 9 digits and lowest number takes precedence).  Example:  if the SSN is 123-45-6789 as  a normal number it would be 123,456,789, and reversed it would be 987,654,321.\nA16.1.1.3.  Assignment selection criteria for CONUS and overseas non-volunteers.   Members, whose assignment preferences could not be approved due to not matching  requirements and members whose assignment preferences in vMPF were blank, are  matched to overseas short/dependent-restricted overseas requirements first, then standard  accompanied overseas requirements second, then CONUS requirements and arranged in  order of grade (lowest grade takes precedence), DOR (latest date takes precedence),  TAFMSD (latest date takes precedence), date of birth (DOB) (latest date takes precedence)  and then, if necessary, in reverse SSN order (use all 9 digits and highest number takes  precedence).  Example:  if the SSN is 123-45-6789 as a normal number it would be  123,456,789, and reversed it would be 987,654,321.\nA16.2.  Organizational Responsibilities.\nA16.2.1.  The Training Wing (TRW) schedule students for wing-controlled follow-on training  immediately upon entry into the basic course at the TRW.\nA16.2.2.  The 319th Training Squadron at Lackland AFB will report Basic Military Training  students classification no later than the end of the fourth week of training. (T-2) Immediately  after classification, they will schedule and update in the MilPDS. (T-2) TRW registrars will  report the students entry into operational training school, a change in technical training  schedule, or completion of technical school to 2 AF, Det 1. (T-2)    DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  507\nA16.2.3.  2 AF, Det 1 reports any changes to course identification number to AFPC/DPMLWA  by email as soon as possible after the class has been activated.\nA16.3.  TRW MPF Student Assignment Section.\nA16.3.1.  The MPF will notify the student, through the unit commander, of the assignment  within 5 duty days after receipt. (T-1) The MPF will also establish a relocation folder and  notify the training squadron of all required assignment actions for the assignment, according  to DAFMAN 36-2102. (T-2)\nA16.3.2.  PCS orders should be accomplished and forwarded to the member as soon as possible  after receipt of the assignment if no special processing requirements exist (i.e., Personnel  Reliability Program/SCI requirements, medical/dental clearances, AF Form 1466, DAF Form  965, etc.).\nA16.3.3.  PCS orders for assignments with special requirements or Personnel Processing  Codes (PPC), such as those stated above, are accomplished upon completion of all mandatory  requirements.  The chief of the student assignments section will establish local procedures to  ensure special requirements are accomplished in the most expedient manner. (T-3) The process  for requirements to be completed and orders processed for the student should be completed  within 15 duty days.\nA16.4.  Student SWAP Program.  This voluntary program was established to afford non-prior  service student members who are assigned in a PCS status at a TRW or Geographically Separated  Units the chance to swap assignments with another student before they graduate from technical  training.  Interested students are solely responsible for finding another student who wants to swap  assignments.  A SWAP involves two or more non-prior service students (AB through A1C).  Note:   If a TTG has an approved follow-on assignment the TTG is ineligible to swap, unless extenuating  circumstances apply.\nA16.4.1.  Eligibility Criteria. Members must meet the below criteria to apply:\nA16.4.1.1.  Not have been notified of pending elimination from training or reclassified into  the AFSC/SFSC that the member is swapping for. (T-1)\nA16.4.1.2.  Be projected graduates of the same course. (T-1)\nA16.4.1.3.  Meet or be able to satisfy all special requirements and PPC requirements before  graduation. (T-1)\nA16.4.1.4.  Have the same AFSC/SFSC including the same prefix and/or suffix (this does  not apply to members who are attending the same phase I core course that is common to  more than one AFSC/SFSC). (T-1)\nA16.4.1.5.  Have a class graduation date within 30 calendar days of each other. (T-1)\nA16.4.1.6.  Not have an assignment as a result of a SWAP (assignment action reason, 2- digit reason code:  SS (Student SWAP)). (T-1) Note:  Only one approved swap is  permitted.\nA16.4.1.7.  Be a U.S. citizen if assignment is to overseas (with exception of Alaska and  Hawaii).  Non-U.S. citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an overseas assignment (other  than Alaska or Hawaii). (T-1)    508  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA16.4.1.8.  Be a U.S. citizen if the assignment requires access to classified information.   Non-U.S. citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an assignment requiring access to classified  information. (T-1)\nA16.4.1.9.  Not have a UIF or have administrative action pending which results in the  establishment of a UIF, if the assignment is to an overseas area. (T-1)\nA16.5.  Grade Criteria.  AB through A1C may swap assignments with each other.  (There are no  grade restrictions for non-prior service students.)\nA16.6.  SWAP Procedures:\nA16.6.1.  Members must submit their SWAP request to the MPF student assignment section  NLT 5 workdays after the student is notified of their assignment. (T-1)\nA16.6.2.  The MPF reports SWAP requests by email within 3 duty days to AFPC/DPMLWA  for processing.  The MPF ensures all pertinent information is contained in the reporting of  SWAPs.  The following format is used:  NAME/SSN (last 4)/OLD PAS/NEW  PAS/AAN/AFSC or SFSC/GRAD DT/REMARK.\nA16.6.3.  A change of either assignment after a SWAP has been approved does not cancel the  SWAP action (i.e., if either member\u2019s assignment was changed the other would continue to  the swapped assignment).  The assignment action reason SS will remain.\nA16.6.4.  Within 3 duty days, AFPC/DPMLWA will process the request for a SWAP and  either approve and update the PDS, or contact the MPF/Geographically Separated Units  notifying them of disapproval. (T-1)\nA16.6.5.  As an exception to the above, students attending Phase II medical training in AFSCs  4H0X1, 4J0X1, 4R0X1, 4T0X1 or 4T0X2 may apply for a SWAP NLT 60 days prior to  projected departure date regardless of their training location.  These members must be reported  to AFPC/DPMLWA in the same manner described above by the MPF servicing the training  location. (T-1) (Note:  Both MPFs will maintain a copy of the SWAP request of each member  and the MPF servicing the member whose last name occurs first in alphabetical order will  submit the requests to the assignment OPR.). (T-3)\nA16.6.6.  The members involved must concur with the SWAP assignments in writing. (T-1)\nA16.7.  Follow-on (FO) Assignment Program.\nA16.7.1.  TRW\u2019s refer to Attachment 3, for complete guidance on the FO assignment  program.  Members selected for a dependent-restricted assignment (NA/12 locations), or who  elect an unaccompanied short tour (24/15 or 24/12 locations) will be briefed during their initial  assignment briefing. (T-1)\nA16.7.2.  TRW\u2019s will allow members 3 duty days to complete their application or decline  participation in writing. (T-3)\nA16.7.3.  Members may apply for up to 16 preferences (8 CONUS and 8 overseas, which can  reflect specific bases, states, regions, locales, or countries).\nA16.7.4.  Method of submitting requests from the technical training wing to AFPC varies  based on the member\u2019s projected departure date.  Members with a projected departure date of  more than 150 days from the assignment selection date have their requests updated by the TRW   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  509  via PDS, utilizing the remarks area to identify requested state or region/locale areas, if desired.   The transaction generates an in-system request to the appropriate assignment OPR  approximately 120 days prior to the member\u2019s projected departure date.  In-system approval  or disapproval from the assignment OPR takes place through PDS within 10 duty days after  receipt.  Members with a projected departure date within 150 days from assignment selection  date should have their preferences forwarded to the assignment OPR by email.  The assignment  OPR will process these requests within 5 duty days and, if necessary, advise the TRW of  disapproval through return email. (T-1)\nA16.7.5.  Members must receive approval or disapproval prior to departure and those with  approved FO assignments have the pertinent information reflected in their PCS orders. (T-1)\nA16.8.  Deferment of Non-prior service Students.  Basic Military Training Students.  The  following deferments or conditions prohibit the PDS from automatically classifying and matching  Basic Military Training student assignments.\nA16.8.1.  Medical/Dental Hold. Deferred with AAC 31, Table 3.1 and Date of Availability as  set by the Medical/Dental Facility.\nA16.8.2.  Recommended for Separation.  Defer with AAC 73 with Date of Availability 6  months from date of recommendation.  If previously classified, cancel projected assignment to  technical training wing and update the Primary, Control, and Duty AFSC to 9T000.\nA16.8.3.  HAF or MAJCOM Hold.  Members identified by the member Classification  Squadron as having unique needs which has a bearing on their assignment.  On approval from  2 AF, Det 1, the member is placed in AAC 70 with a Date of Availability equal to their  graduation date from Basic Military Training.  If not resolved by that date, the member  Classification Squadron Commander will place a statement on the DD Form 4, waiving the  problem the members might be encountering. (T-1) The Date of Availability can never exceed  the Basic Military Training graduation date.\nA16.8.4.  Airman Classification Squadron Assessment Branch.  Members identified for special  processing by the assessment branch will be placed in AAC 25 with a Date of Availability 1  workday before classification of the week group. (T-1) A later Date of Availability may be  input manually.\nA16.8.5.  Enlisted Under the Guarantee AFSC/SFSC Program.  Members are placed in AAC  71 with a Date of Availability equal to Basic Military Training graduation date.\nA16.8.6.  Join Spouse Applicants.  Members are placed in AAC 69 with a Date of Availability  equal to Basic Military Training graduation date.  The member Classification Squadron will  ensure a join spouse requirement is considered during classification so that compatible  AFSC/SFSCs are selected. (T-1)\nA16.8.7.  Other.  Members in a duty status code other than present for duty (code \u201c00\u201d) are not  considered for classification or reassignment.\nA16.9.  Delaying a PCS Move for a Non-prior service Student.  PCS moves for Non-prior  service students may not be delayed except:\nA16.9.1.  When a humanitarian or EFMP assignment request is pending.   510  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA16.9.2.  When a join spouse application is pending.  Members who marry another military  member during technical training will not depart until the join spouse assignment is complete.\nA16.9.3.  When PCS involves a female member who is pregnant or a member whose spouse  is pregnant, consistent with pregnancy deferment procedures in this instruction.\nA16.9.4.  When the student is under consideration for a selectively manned or special-duty  assignment.\nA16.9.5.  When pending completion of additional assignment processing actions required by  a PPC or awaiting approval to proceed on assignment.\nA16.9.6.  When pending a response to an application for concurrent travel.\nA16.9.7.  When the student is placed on Commander Directed Hold (AAC 21) or Under  AFOSI/Security Forces Investigation (AAC 17).  Commanders will validate the need to retain  a student for further observation or contemplated administrative action. (T-2) Once validated,  the commander must immediately initiate a request to place the member on hold. (T-2) The  commander\u2019s request includes:  grade, name, SSN (last 4), CAFSC/CSFSC, student status  (projected graduation date, date eliminated, and so forth), applicable AAC from Table 3.1 (if  different than AAC 21), rationale for action, and Date of Availability.  The request is hand- carried or electronically transmitted/faxed to the MPF student assignment section to prevent  student departure.  If the commander determines the member is about to depart the base, notify  the MPF student assignment section telephonically to prevent departure.  In these cases, written  confirmation as described above is completed within 1 duty day.  If there is a disagreement  between the commander and the MPF regarding a request, it is elevated to the next higher level  of command until resolved.\nA16.9.7.1.  MPF must establish procedures to make sure action is taken to prevent  departure of a member upon receipt of a commander\u2019s request. (T-2) In addition,  commanders will set up procedures to ensure the hold request is provided to the MPF  student assignment section. (T-2)\nA16.9.7.2.  When circumstances which required the member to be delayed cease to exist  and the member is qualified for reassignment, the commander takes immediate action to  release the member, in writing.  This notification is provided to the MPF student  assignment section.\nA16.10.  Assignment of Military Couples Involving TTGs.  (See Attachment 8 for complete  guidance on the join spouse assignment program).\nA16.10.1.  In those situations where the student was married to another military member prior  to Basic Military Training and intent code is updated via vMPF, or when the marriage occurs  at the training location or after graduation, the following applies:\nA16.10.2.  Members must update join spouse intent code and submit a \u201chard-copy\u201d join spouse  application (see PSD Guide:  Join Spouse Assignment Program) to request join spouse  assignment consideration as soon as possible after the date of marriage. (T-1)\nA16.10.2.1.  The MPF verifies the member\u2019s eligibility, update PDS, suspenses a copy of  the application, and notifies AFPC/DPMLWA via email (info spouse\u2019s MPF, if  applicable).  Notification should include the following information on each member:   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  511\nA16.10.2.1.1.  Name (Last, First, Middle Initial).\nA16.10.2.1.2.  Grade.\nA16.10.2.1.3.  SSN (last 4).\nA16.10.2.1.4.  CAFSC/CSFSC.\nA16.10.2.1.5.  Graduation Date.\nA16.10.2.1.6.  Current unit of assignment.\nA16.10.2.1.7.  Requested assignment location.\nA16.10.2.1.8.  Date of marriage and join spouse intent code.\nA16.10.2.1.9.  The following mandatory statement:  \u201cThe marriage certificate has been  verified and join spouse application is on file in the MPF.\u201d\nA16.10.2.1.10.  If one spouse is a member of another branch of the U.S. Armed Forces,  written confirmation from that member confirming join spouse is desired must be  submitted with the join spouse application. (T-1) Include the spouse\u2019s grade, name,  SSN (last 4), AFSC/SFSC or MOS, job title, current duty location, and the name, grade,  and DSN of spouse\u2019s assignment clerk.\nA16.10.3.  AFPC/DPMLWA provides the MPF the final decision via email.  The MPF uses  this authority to reassign students.  Students must not depart until the MPF receives the final  decision from the assignment OPR. (T-1) PDS notification confirming approval (PTI 517)  follows depending on proximity of graduation date (Note:  Do not delay processing pending  PDS confirmation).\nA16.10.4.  Students indicating they are marrying enroute PCS must be counseled not to delay  applying for join spouse assignment until arrival at the new duty location. (T-1) Advise them  to report immediately to the nearest Air Force or Space Force installation to apply.  The  member will not be reimbursed for travel in conjunction with such application and remain in  leave status (delay enroute) while the application is pending. (T-1)\nA16.10.5.  Members will not be retrained for the sole purpose of making a join spouse  assignment for 12 months after graduation from technical training. (T-1) However, with  approval of 2 AF, Det 1, they may be transferred to another course before school entry or if  the training already received is applicable to the new course.\nA16.11.  Student Quality Control Procedures.\nA16.11.1.  Members (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) who cannot or  will not meet acceptable standards of conduct or duty performance are identified and separated  from the Air Force. (T-1)\nA16.11.2.  All administrative or judicial actions, initiated or contemplated, are completed  before the member is reassigned.\nA16.11.3.  Non-prior service student assignments are mandatory PCS moves, but only to  CONUS locations.\nA16.11.4.  The losing commander notifies the gaining commander, in writing, when a student  is recommended for assignment and administrative action has been established.  Include an   512  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  explanation of the member\u2019s situation and the specific actions taken.  If further action is  desirable, but impractical, the specific reason for precluding further action is fully explained.\nA16.11.5.  Members (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) will not be  assigned to or allowed to leave for any overseas or CONUS location when placed on AAC 10  through 21, excluding 14, where a quality-control-oriented PPC applies, without the approval  of AFPC/DP3AM.\nA16.12.  Security Clearance and Access to Classified Information.\nA16.12.1.  Only those TTGs requiring a security clearance for award of an AFSC/SFSC should  be placed in involuntary hold status.  MPFs must ensure that SCI nomination packages are  forwarded to the Defense Investigative Service by the local Security Forces Investigative  Office. (T-2)\nA16.12.2.  MPF will establish procedures to ensure security clearance requests for  investigation are initiated no later than 3 duty days after receipt of the assignment notification.  (T-2) All initial clearance processing is completed no later than 30 days after receipt or the  graduation date, whichever is sooner.\nA16.13.  Return of Graduated Students Enroute PCS.\nA16.13.1.  Commanders have the ultimate responsibility of ensuring only quality members are  retained in the Air Force and permitted to be reassigned.  When a member has departed on  PCS but not arrived at the gaining location, the decision to cancel their assignment for the  purpose of returning to the previous duty station should serve the overall best interests of the  AF.  Due to the PCS cost and personal hardship that may result, a member who has departed  on PCS will only be directed to return to the previous duty station upon approval of  AFPC/DP3AM after it is determined the action for which return is requested cannot be  completed at the gaining unit. (T-1) Requests to return a member for the purpose of  administering disciplinary actions (Article 15, Letter of Reprimand, or Control Roster) are  normally disapproved.  The gaining commander can administer these actions.  Members may,  however, be returned for involuntary separation, court-martial, completion of an AFOSI, etc.   It is the decision of AFPC/DP3AM to cancel a member\u2019s assignment that actually causes the  member\u2019s return to the previous duty station.\nA16.13.2.  A commander considering requesting the return of a member who has departed PCS  but who has not arrived at the gaining location must complete the actions described below:\nA16.13.2.1.  Contact the local Staff Judge Advocate to determine whether return is or is  not legally justified.  If determined to be legally sufficient, contact the MPF Chief who  provides AFPC/DP3AM the specifics of the case for their approval/disapproval.  These  actions are normally completed on the same day of the request.\nA16.13.2.2.  If return is approved, the commander notifies the member by telephone or  overnight express mail.  Telephonic notification is recommended as long as the  conversation is witnessed and an appropriate memo for record is prepared.  The  commander must give the member a specific RNLTD for their return. (T-1) If the member  lacks funds for the return trip, advise them to report to the nearest FSO with original PCS  orders to obtain necessary funds and/or commercial tickets for the return travel.   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  513\nA16.13.3.  Members returning must in-process through the MPF. (T-1) If involuntary  separation or commander hold (AAC 21) is being initiated, the member must be notified in  writing of the action and its ramifications prior to implementation. (T-1)\nA16.13.4.  Upon member\u2019s return, the MPF will gain the member back to file. (T-1) The  original orders are rescinded with a statement in the remarks that the member was ordered to  return to the losing base (CONUS base) from their leave address (state location) by the  commander.  The MPF will ensure the FSO receives a copy of the rescission orders. (T-1)\nA16.14.  Disposition of First Time Technical Training Eliminees.\nA16.14.1.  Non-prior service students who eliminate from their training course will be  evaluated for retention in the Air Force. (T-1) If the behavior or action that resulted in the  elimination from training is grounds for separation, proper action is taken.  If, after evaluation,  it is decided to retain the member, then the following applies:\nA16.14.1.1.  The MPF sends an email to 2 AF, Det 1 with an information copy to  AFPC/DPMLWA (AETC/SGPS with information copy to AFPC/DPMLWA on members  eliminated from medical training) within 3 duty days after the elimination is formally  approved, or 3 duty days after the decision to retain the member was made.  Report  disqualified members according to AFMAN 36-2100.  Email includes the following:\nA16.14.1.1.1.  Grade, name, SSN (last 4), AFSC/SFSC, physical profile (PULHESX -  Physical condition, upper extremity, lower extremity, hearing-ears, vision-eyes,  neuropsychiatric-stability, physical work capacity), color vision normal (yes or no),  depth perception normal (yes or no), and whether the member possesses a current state  driver\u2019s license (yes or no).\nA16.14.1.1.2.  Course from which eliminated.  Include the course length, start date, and  date of final elimination action.  For unqualified students, indicate only the  AFSC/SFSC for which member is unqualified.\nA16.14.1.1.3.  Reasons for elimination as stated in the counseling records.  For  unqualified students, indicate the reasons for disqualification.\nA16.14.1.1.4.  Up to 6 AFSC/SFSC preferences for which the member qualifies.  If  applicable, include a summary of the member\u2019s experience or interests that may assist  in reclassification.\nA16.14.1.1.5.  If further technical training is not recommended, give specific rationale  why administrative separation action was not taken.\nA16.14.1.1.6.  A complete account of all actions contained in the member\u2019s UIF, if  applicable.\nA16.14.1.1.7.  Any other facts, recommendations, or information that can assist in  determining a disposition that is in the best interest of the DAF.  Comments should  include whether the member is Personnel Reliability Program certifiable, member\u2019s  attitude and motivation, along with any other pertinent factors.  Also, include  commander\u2019s recommendation.       514  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA16.14.2.  If reentry into another technical training course is decided, 2 AF advises the MPF  and AFPC/DPMLWA of the reclassification AFSC/SFSC and course data.  AFPC/DPMLWA  will update the PAFSC/PSFSC or CAFSC/CSFSC and the MPF will update the  DAFSC/DSFSC to the new AFSC/SFSC using PDS. (T-1)\nA16.14.3.  To ensure prompt disposition, 2 AF and AFPC/DPMLWA will complete their  required actions after receipt of eliminee or unqualified student reports. (T-1) Each level of  review must complete its action within 3 duty days after receipt. (T-1)\nA16.14.4.  Commanders should avoid multiple (more than once) reclassification of students  who clearly do not meet acceptable standards.  This includes standards of academics,  performance, conduct, bearing and behavior, discipline, medical, or any characteristic that does  not promote accomplishment of the AF\u2019s mission.  When students are recommended for  reclassification more than once, the approval authority is the group commander.\nA16.15.  TTG Force Gain Procedures.  The purpose is to alleviate the excessive TDY funding  being expended due to student course completion problems at the TTC.\nA16.15.1.  TTC identifies and documents a valid extended delay in training with an estimated  completion date and Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) for the student and forwards via  email to 2 AF, Det 1 organizational email address (2af.det1dxa@us.af.mil) on the global  address listing (GAL).  Valid documentation may pertain to medical hold, security clearance  delays, punitive actions, etc.  Delays in training, because the member missed their class seat  and has to wait a couple weeks for the next class is not considered valid.  However, if there are  extenuating circumstances, AFPC/DPMLWA will consider them on a case-by-case basis.\nA16.15.2.  2 AF, Det 1 will evaluate the TTC documentation.  If they concur, the request will  be sent to AFPC/DPMLWA via email (address:  AFPC.DP0SW.TTG@US.AF.MIL)with  courtesy copy to AETC/FMAT requesting the member be PCS\u2019d to the TTC as an exception  to policy.\nA16.15.3.  AFPC/DPMLWA will coordinate the exception to policy with AFPC/DP3AM.\nA16.15.4.  After approval or disapproval by AFPC/DP3AM, AFPC/DPMLWA will notify 2  AF, Det 1.  If approved, AFPC/DPMLWA will load the assignment to the gaining TTC.  This  assignment action will consummate the TDY status once the member is gained to the TTC file.   If disapproved, AFPC/DPMLWA will notify 2 AF, Det 1 and provide final assignment action  instructions.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  515  Attachment 17  PCS OF MEMBERS DIRECTED UNDER AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER PRESCRIBING  INSTRUCTION (LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND BELOW AND ALL ENLISTED)\nA17.1.  Introduction.  While the term \u201cassignments\u201d is frequently used to describe all PCSs, the  fact is there are various types of PCS moves directed by OPRs not within AFPC/DP3AM (RegAF)  or ETMO (USSF) which are made under the authority of another prescribing instruction.  As a  reminder, with the exception of patient assignments, assignment OPRs within AFPC/DP3AM  (RegAF) or ETMO (USSF) are responsible for only operational, rotational, force structure, and  training PCSs.\nA17.2.  PCS in Conjunction With Other Actions.  The following PCSs, with the exception of  some patient assignments, are directed by OPRs outside AFPC/DP3AM (RegAF) or ETMO  (USSF).  The OPR for the action concerned is the OPR for the PCS and is the PCS Authority.\nA17.2.1.  Accession PCSs (except for medical officers which is AFPC/DPMNP).  OPR is  AFPC/DPMLT.  With the exception of those designated at the discretion of SecAF, CSAF, or  CSO, assignments of all USAF Academy graduate accessions or members cross- commissioning from other Service Academies are assigned at or below the wing/delta level.\nA17.2.2.  PCS in conjunction with separation and retirement (includes for processing of  administrative separation/discharge).  OPR is AFPC/DPMST.\nA17.2.3.  PCS of patients to a MTF or between MTFs.  OPR can be either the gaining MTF  Commander or AFPC/DPMNP, Medical Retention Standards Branch, in accordance with  AFMAN 41-210.  Upon release from assignment to the MTF, members are reported to  AFPC/DPMNP who, in turn, request the assignment OPR direct reassignment as appropriate.\nA17.2.4.  PCS of prisoners to a confinement facility (including from overseas to a CONUS  facility) or between confinement facilities.  OPR is Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC),  Lackland AFB, Texas.\nA17.2.5.  PCS of members to locations near their HOR who are placed in appellate leave status  incident to court-martial conviction.  OPR is AFSFC, Lackland AFB, Texas.\nA17.2.6.  PCS or TDY related to judicial proceedings (court-martial or other reasons when  directed by the MAJCOM/FLDCOM JA) according to DAFI 51-201, Administration of  Military Justice.  OPR is AF/JA.\nA17.3.  How PCSs Differ.  The PCSs listed in paragraph A17.2 (frequently referred to as  assignments) differ from those authorized by this instruction in the following major ways:\nA17.3.1.  The selection process (qualifications, ODSD/short tour return date, date arrived  station, time-on-station, retainability, and so on) prescribed in this instruction to determine  which member is selected for PCS does not apply.\nA17.3.2.  The purpose of the PCS is not to fill a valid manpower authorization at the gaining  location and/or not to have the member perform duty in their AFSC/SFSC.\nA17.3.3.  The PCSs may or may not be projected in the PDS and do not use an operational,  rotational, or training AAN.  The member is \u201cassigned\u201d using unprojected gain procedures or  as ordered by the OPR.   516  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA17.3.4.  It may not be appropriate for the cost of the PCS to be charged to the same PCS ID  codes used for operational, rotational, and training assignments.\nA17.3.5.  It is incorrect to cite AFI 36-2110 as the \u201cauthority\u201d for the PCS.\nA17.3.6.  7-day option procedures do not apply.\nA17.4.  Similarities of the PCSs.  Similarities do exist between the PCSs listed in paragraph\nA17.2 and those authorized by this instruction and directed by the assignment OPRs shown in  Table 2.1.  They include:\nA17.4.1.  The member may change unit of assignment and/or make a permanent change of  station.\nA17.4.2.  Most of the moves involve an order directing the PCS.\nA17.4.3.  The PCS allowances members may accrue may be different for each kind of PCS.\nA17.4.4.  Because relocation is involved, MPFs assist those agencies directing the PCS and in  processing the member for PCS.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  517  Attachment 18  DIVERSE SLATES FOR KEY DEVELOPMENTAL ASSIGNMENTS\nA18.1.  Purpose  . Key Developmental Assignments such as Executive Officer, Aide de Camp,  Military Assistant, Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA), Career Field Manager (CFM), and  Commander\u2019s Action Group Chief are used to develop and prepare military personnel for future  senior leadership roles. Qualified members and Guardians considered for these key positions are  identified on slates, or candidate pools. The purpose of diverse slates is to enable candidate pools  that better reflect the demographic diversity of the USAF and USSF.\nA18.2.  Diverse Candidate Slate Requirement.  Hiring officials will develop and consider slates  comprised of at least one candidate, from a slate size of five or less.  For slates greater than five  members, 30% of the slate should be comprised of members from underrepresented groups, based  on gender, race and/or ethnicity (see AFI 36-7001).  This requirement does not mandate any  specific hiring selection decisions. This policy applies to Total Force hiring processes where a  formal slate for respective key developmental positions is currently used. For those key military  developmental positions that do not require a formal slate of candidates, hiring officials should  begin developing and selecting from a slate in accordance with this guidance. The Air Force  Personnel Center (AFPC) will ensure slates for STARNOM/CAPNOM requirements consist of at  least one underrepresented diverse candidate based on gender, race and/or ethnicity. (T-1)\nA18.3.  Slate Requirements.  For slates greater than five members, at least 30% of the slate  should be comprised of members from underrepresented groups, based on gender, race and/or  ethnicity (see AFI 36-7001).\nA18.4.  Reporting Requirements.  For wing/delta level organizations, the MAJCOM/FLDCOM  Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officers (CDIO) (or designated organization) will report outcomes  and progress, including metrics, at least annually to AF/A1P or SF/S1P and the Secretary of the  Air Force Office of Diversity and Inclusion (SAF/ODI).  For organizations above wing/delta level,  AFPC will capture this data, to include data for SEAs and CFMs.\nA18.4.1.  Data will include:\nA18.4.1.1.  Race, ethnicity, gender information of the developed candidate slate. (T-1)\nA18.4.1.2.  Race, ethnicity, gender of the selected hire. (T-1)\nA18.4.2.  In the event a developed slate does not consist of at least one diverse candidate, hiring  officials will continue to fill the position requirement and report why a diverse slate was not  attained. (T-1)\nA18.5.  Key Developmental Assignments.  At a minimum, hiring officials will track and report  on the following developmental assignments at the designated level:\nA18.5.1.  Executive Officer [97E coded] (HAF, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, FOA, and NAF). (T-1)\nA18.5.2.  Executive Officer (Wing and Delta Commander Level). (T-1)\nA18.5.3.  Aide-de-Camp (HAF, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM). (T-1)\nA18.5.4.  Senior Enlisted Leader (HAF). (T-1)\nA18.5.5.  Career Field Manager (Officer/Enlisted). (T-1)    518  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024\nA18.5.6.  Commander\u2019s Action Group Chief (HAF, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM). (T-1)\nA18.5.7.  STARNOM/CAPNOM [Officer/Enlisted] (AFPC). (T-1)\nA18.5.8.  Senior Enlisted Advisor (HAF, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM). (T-1)\nA18.5.9.  Military Aide (HAF, MAJCOM, and FLDCOM). (T-1)      DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  519  Attachment 19  DIVERSE SLATES FOR NON-STATUTORY SELECTION BOARDS (NOT  APPLICABLE TO AFR)\nA19.1.  Purpose  . Non-Statutory Selection Boards are used to develop and prepare military  personnel for future senior leadership roles. Qualified members selected from these non-statutory  boards must be identified on slates, or candidate pools. The purpose of diverse slates is to enable  candidate pools that better reflect the demographic diversity of the USAF and USSF.\nA19.2.  Non-Statutory Boards  . At a minimum, hiring and or selecting officials will track and  report on the following non-statutory boards:\nA19.2.1.  Weapons Instructor Board. (T-1)\nA19.2.2.  Rated Crossflow Board. (T-1)\nA19.2.3.

Last, Rank, USAF)  Unit of Assignment  Installation ST Zip Code    SUBJECT:  Statement of Understanding (SOU) - Active Duty Sanctuary Agreement    1.  I, _______________________________, having accumulated at least 16 \u00bd years, but less  than 20 years Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS), understand that I am in or nearing  the active duty sanctuary zone, as defined by Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 36- 2110, Total Force Assignments, paragraph 17.4.1.1.1.    2.  If my voluntary active duty orders (Title 10 or Title 32, not for training) are for less than 180  days, I am waiving the right to claim sanctuary protection.  However, if my orders are extended  past 180 days and places me beyond 18 years TAFMS, I understand that I have the right to claim  active duty sanctuary protection.  However, I acknowledge that I may be reassigned in  accordance with the needs and priorities of the Air Force Reserve, and such assignment  terminates upon reaching eligibility for an immediate active duty retirement, in accordance with  DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.6.1.  Continued service beyond this Final Tour is not a right and is  based upon the member finding an acceptable position in the Selected Reserve, in accordance  with DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.12    3. By signing below, I acknowledge this statement of understanding will remain in effect until I  have reached 20 years of Total Active Federal Military Service and will be kept on file in my  master personnel record, in accordance with DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.8.2.  This SOU does  not need to be re-accomplished with new orders.

I support the action of (Requestor) to waive his/her sanctuary protection to perform the above  voluntary tour of active duty.     2.

This waiver, shown by my signature below, means I will not receive sanctuary protection.  Therefore, I may be released from active duty without SecAF approval even though serving on  active duty within two years of becoming eligible for retired pay.    4. I also understand no order request submitted requiring me to perform further voluntary  active duty service is effective until this waiver is acknowledged and tour approved by The  Adjunct General or designee.    I, (Typed, Rank, Name, and last 4 of SSN), voluntarily waive my right to invoke sanctuary  protection as provided under AFI 36-2110, 10 USC \u00a7 12686(b).

I further  understand that should I attempt to claim sanctuary while performing this tour of duty, my orders  may be terminated prior to the end of the tour.  I understand that for each type of active duty tour or extension thereof that I request, except  Active Duty for Training, a new waiver will be required and accomplished.  _____ I understand that my active duty tour will not begin until I have proper approval from  The Adjunct General or designee.  I understand that I will continue to accrue active duty points while performing this tour with a  waiver in place; upon accumulation of approximately 7305 active duty points, I will have  earned an active duty retirement and may retire immediately with an active duty annuity, or  continue to participate for additional points and pay.  I understand this sanctuary waiver is irrevocable for the voluntary period of active duty for  which the waiver has been requested.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  523  ______ I understand that this written document will be filed at my State Joint Forces  Headquarters, FSS /Force Support Flights and my unit as evidence that I have waived my  right to sanctuary protection.  ___________________________        _________________________  Member\u2019s Full Signature (Date)        Witness Signature (Date)    1st Ind, Unit Commander Wing Commander  State Joint Forces Headquarters In Turn    I support the action of requestor to waive his sanctuary protection to perform the above  voluntary tour of active duty.    _____________________________   Typed Signature Block and Signature  cc: Individual      This document requires the collection and maintenance of information protected by the Privacy  Act of 1974.

On 28 July 2020, the Secretary of the Air Force established the  CCCP.  The program is compromised of the Court-Ordered Child Custody Assignment (CCCA)  and Court-Ordered Child Custody Deferment (CCCD) assignment options; and is intended to  increase military family stability.  Enrollment in the program is voluntary and self-initiated.\nA26.1.1.  Assignment authorities will attempt to facilitate the assignment or deferment of  members with a court-ordered child custody decree regarding their biological or adopted  children to the geographic location of the children where they reside more than 50% of  designated parenting time with the primary custodial parent.  The geographic location is the  region that allows a military member to co-parent within a reasonable traveling distance (1 day  of travel) per the JTR.\nA26.1.2.  Provided the eligibility criteria is met, members may be considered for an assignment  where they can reside close to their children who reside more than 50% of designated parenting  time with the primary custodial parent named in the divorce decree or the court-ordered child  custody decree.\nA26.1.3.  Members are still required to fulfill obligations inherent to all military members and  they are considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and perform duties,  which require the skills in which they are trained subject to PCS eligibility.\nA26.1.4.  Members should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family  planning based on the assumption they can always be assigned to the location of the co-parent  of their child(ren).  All members should expect periods of separation during their careers.   Regardless of the provisions in this attachment, members should understand that an assignment  or deferment of current assignment is weighed against the needs of the Air Force or Space  Force as the main priority, and even with a valid court-ordered child custody document, an  assignment or deferment is not guaranteed.\nA26.2.  Eligibility Considerations.\nA26.2.1.  General Information.  To be eligible for enrollment into the CCCP, service members  must provide required documentation, request enrollment into the program, be named a  custodial parent in a finalized court-ordered child custody decree and have that child(ren)  enrolled in DEERS.\nA26.2.1.1.

CCCD consideration for in-place 24-month deferment or assignment  cancellation with an in-place 24-month deferment to remain at their current CONUS  location for those members not serving a CONUS Maximum Stabilized Tour.  Assignment  cancellations must be processed in accordance with paragraph 6.10.\nA26.2.1.4.  Preferences will be reviewed and considered in the exact order listed in the  application; however, preferences that are not in the geographical location of the children  are counter to the program and therefore they will not be considered.\nA26.2.1.5.  Manning must support at the gaining location without overmanning the  location.  Losing manning is not factored in the application review.  The location must have  a valid, funded position in the member\u2019s grade and skill-level. The assignment teams will  take into consideration the grade, skill-level and overall manning of the listed preferences.   Manning determination will be conducted by the assignment teams at the time of  application.\nA26.2.1.6.  Members must meet all PCS eligibility requirements.\nA26.2.1.7.  Eligible members will have an ALC \u201cF\u201d updated to their record and the  expiration date established as the first day of the month of the youngest child\u2019s 18th  birthday named in the decree.  This ALC does not defer a member from assignments;  instead, it provides a data point of identifying members in the program.  After the 18th  birthday of the youngest child, the ALC will automatically drop from the member\u2019s record.\nA26.2.2.  CCCP Restrictions/Limitation  .  Members are not eligible for enrollment into the  CCCP if:\nA26.2.2.1.  The youngest child, subject to the custody order(s), will be age 17 or older at  the time of the application.\nA26.2.2.2.

PCS vulnerability is the relative  standing of a member among their peers for PCS selection in comparison to projected  personnel requirements in a particular period of time (usually the next 24 months).  PCS  vulnerability changes after each assignment cycle, therefore vulnerability is only known  and reviewed by the assignment teams at the time of the application.\nA26.4.2.7.

This section only applies to military  members currently married to another military member who either one or both share custody of a  biological or adopted child with another military member. A military couple with a military co- parent is defined as a current military married to military couple who one of the members of this  marriage was previously married or never married to the other military member whom they have  children with.   One or both members of a dual married military couple named in a court ordered  decree may request CCCA/CCCD consideration in their own right when eligible; however, they  both must be PCS eligible and have join spouse intent code \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d. (Join Spouse intent codes  are updated for the married military couple only). (T-1)  If only one member is submitting then  manning must support a join spouse assignment for their current military spouse in order for the  assignment to be approved. (T-1)\nA26.5.1.  The join spouse intent code is a factor when considering the request. If the intent  code is \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d and only one member of the military couple is submitting a CCCA/CCCD  application, then the spouse will automatically be considered for join spouse assignment or  deferment in conjunction with their spouse\u2019s CCCA/CCCD request. If manning supports and  the request is approved, the eligible member will receive a CCCA assignment (assignment  action reason CC) and their spouse will receive a join spouse assignment (assignment action  reason A4 [join spouse]). If manning does not support the CCCA or join spouse assignment,  the CCCA request is disapproved.\nA26.5.2.  Members can only request CCCA/CCCD for themselves if they are the noncustodial  co-parent and the children reside more than 50% of designated parenting time with the primary  custodial parent (other than the member applying for CCCP).  If a request is disapproved, it  would be incumbent upon the other military parent for which child-custody applies to apply in  their own right.\nA26.5.3.  If one member of a military couple is currently serving a CONUS maximum tour  (AAC 50) and meets the eligibility criteria to apply, then they submit their CCCA/CCCD  request during their eligibility window and their spouse (who does not meet CCCA/CCCD  eligibility criteria) is considered for a join spouse assignment or deferment.\nA26.5.4.  When both members are eligible for CCCA consideration, both members of this  military couple have a child or children with a different co-parent, and submit simultaneous  applications, the assignment preferences must match in the same order. (T-1)  When both   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  535  applications are approved, then both members are moved under the CCCA program  (assignment action reason CC).  This identifies both assignments were made to support both  members of this military couple for CCCA.\nA26.5.5.  When one member of a military couple requests a CCCA/CCCD and the join spouse  intent code is \u201cH\u201d the request will be considered for only that member. (T-1) Refer to  Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.5.1, and paragraph A8.5.4.3 for information on how join  spouse intent code \u201cH\u201d will affect future join spouse assignment consideration.\nA26.6.

When circumstances arise  which may warrant involuntary cancellation of a CCCA, the MPF must immediately notify the  assignment OPR via CMS.
