Service member is not eligible to apply for any self-initiated assignment programs until the deferment has expired. A  service member who had an action approved under one of these programs before being placed in a code making them  ineligible may retain the previously approved action if expiration of the ineligibility condition is before the departure  date/DEROS.  An RNLTD cannot be changed for the sole purpose of allowing a service member’s deferment to expire  before the departure date/DEROS (Includes when additional retainability is required due to change in PCS, TDY, or  training requirement).  4.

Requires assignment OPR approval prior to update of this code on a service member.  The assignment action reason  for a PCS or other similar approval (such as a letter/memo, assignment trailer remarks, approved application, PCS orders,  and so on) may be used by MPF as authority for update of an AAC.   12. Although every effort is made to ensure completion of the deferment period after retraining, the deferment may end  before the scheduled date in order to meet higher priority manning needs.  AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO must approve  all waivers of the date of availability for FY service member retraining programs.  AFPC/DPMOS must approve all  waivers of the date of availability for First Sergeants.  Waiver authority for NCOs retraining under FY enlisted service  member retraining program and subsequently selected for RegAF CMSgt is AF/A1LE and USSF CMSgt and SMSgt is  SF/S1L. (T-1)   13.

This code/date is solely used to identify a First Sergeant’s second or subsequent tour; this is not a deferment code to  stabilize to a specific location.    18. Calculate date of availability by adding 12 months to the close out date of the referral performance report then update  date of availability as the 1st of the month following the 12 months for officers or the 1st of the month following the static  close out date for enlisted.  Example:  Referral Enlisted Performance Report for E-4 closed out on 18 July 2015, date of  availability is 1 April 2016 since the static close out date is 31 March.  The code is removed when an service member’s  subsequent Officer Performance Report/Enlisted Performance Report is written that is not a referral report.

It is recognized that the minimums in Table 4.2 may not be adequate in all circumstances  for all members.  However, generally the minimums established provide enough time for  most members and most base agencies to take care of essential processing or other  requirements.  In some instances, essential processing or other actions may need to be  completed via a power of attorney, by mail or message, or rescheduled on a priority basis  due to member’s absence on TDY.  Authority to waive the established time-on-station  minimums is delegated to the unit commander provided waiver does not interfere with the  member meeting the RNLTD for a projected PCS, or separation/retirement on the  scheduled date.  Members should be given the opportunity to state if a hardship would be  created as a result of a waiver and commanders should confirm that all required PCS,  separation or retirement actions can be accomplished.  Example:  a member who has no  dependents and resides on-base in unaccompanied housing may not require 30 days on  station immediately preceding separation; or, a member scheduled to take 30 days leave in  conjunction with PCS may agree to reduce the number of days leave in order to remain on   84  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  TDY for an additional period of time negating the requirement for TDY replacement; or,  if  necessary, a commander may disapprove delay enroute in conjunction with a member’s  PCS in order to complete the TDY and still comply with the RNLTD for a projected PCS.",

Therefore, if the first course graduates on the 1st of February and the subsequent course starts  on the 15th of February, the member is charged 11 days leave.  The 2nd of February is the  mandatory travel day, leave begins on the 3rd of February and continues through the 13th of  February, and leave stops when the member arrives on the next RNETD (14 February—one  day prior to the subsequent course start date).  8.

Use of the term diversion should signal a high degree of urgency to all who  are responsible for processing the change.  A diversion can impose a severe personal and/or  financial hardship on the member, unfairly place a member at a disadvantage, and result in  excessive PCS costs to the government.  Before directing a diversion, the assignment OPR should  carefully weigh the circumstances and alternatives.  (See paragraph 4.13 for requests to place a  member in a “TDY Hold” status when a temporary situation dictates a member not return to their  previous permanent duty station, nor proceed to the original gaining location, and a decision is  pending regarding a new gaining permanent duty station.)  A member who is diverted enroute is  not afforded a 7-day option period to take action in lieu of PCS since they have already departed  on PCS.

The fact that a condition  meets the definition of surplus does not mean that PCA or PCS reassignment action is taken to  resolve it.  For USAF, the AFPC assignment OPR works with the AFPC functional assignment  managers to resolve surplus issues.

The  minimum time-on-station for a non-career officer or first term Airman or Guardian is based on the  specific reason for PCS shown in Column A, and not on the fact a member is a non-career officer or  first term Airman or Guardian.  3. Operational PCS is defined as moves between permanent duty stations that are not within the same  corporate city limit; are within the same overseas country but do not cross the border of a country in  which currently assigned; or move is not to/from a school which is 20 weeks or longer in duration.   DOES NOT include base closure or force structure related moves.    Examples:    CONUS to CONUS move:  Randolph AFB to Hill AFB.  overseas to overseas (within same country) move:  Osan (Air Base) AB, Korea to Kunsan AB, Korea;  and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska to Eielson AFB, Alaska.   4. Rotational PCS is defined as moves between permanent duty stations CONUS to overseas and  overseas to CONUS, or move is not within the same overseas country and does cross the border of the  country in which assigned to another overseas country.  DOES NOT include base closure or force  structure related moves.  Examples:    CONUS to overseas move:  Keesler AFB to Andersen AFB, Guam; and Scott AFB to Canada.  overseas to CONUS move:  Ramstein AB, Germany to Columbus AFB.  overseas to overseas move:  Aviano AB, Italy to Ramstein AB, Germany; and Osan AB, Korea to  Incirlik AB, Turkey.  5. May be used only when the reason for surplus is one of those reasons listed in paragraph 6.45.  If a  member is surplus for a reason other than those listed, then an exception must be requested according to  paragraph 6.5 (to include a waiver of time-on-station). (T-1) Also see Rule 19.    6. Members accompanied by dependents require 24 months’ time-on-station before PCS.  Single or  unaccompanied members require 15 months’ time-on-station before PCS.  Members are assigned to a  maximum tour and upon expiration of AAC 50, they will PCS.  7.

Note:  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraphs 6.28.  When PCS is to an overseas location, see Table",
6.6,2,6,['6'],"2. Certain assignments require service retainability greater than the minimum.  When applicable,  assignment OPRs state the retainability required in assignment remarks, additional assignment  instructions, or a PPC.  3. When the member is ineligible to obtain 12 months retainability (example:  an officer has an  established date of separation or retirement date, an members is HYT restricted, or is ineligible due to  quality control or some other reason) or declines to obtain the retainability (example:  an enlisted member  signs a DAF Form 964, or an officer elects to 7-day opt), the DEROS is extended to equal the date of  separation/retirement date.  Normally this involuntary overseas tour extension is accomplished  automatically by the PDS.   4. When a member is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retainability (see note 3 above) and has  less than 7 months from DEROS to date of separation/retirement date, the DEROS is extended to equal  date of separation/retirement date.  When a member, who is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months  retainability, has at least 7 months from DEROS to date of separation, assignment OPRs provide an  assignment (as an exception to the requirement that members have 12 months service retainability).  5. A member eligible to obtain 12 months retainability must do so. (T-1) Members may not extend or  agree to obligated service just long enough to qualify for the 7-month retainability exception in note 4.   Example:  An officer with an indefinite date of separation will incur a 12-month ADSC upon PCS.  The  member may not agree to incur only a 7-month PCS ADSC.  An enlisted member eligible to extend to  meet the full 12-month retainability requirement will do so.  The member cannot extend just enough to be  eligible for the 7-month exception.  6. A member who cannot obtain the full 12 months retainability but can obtain at least 7 (or more) months  retainability, must obtain the maximum retainability for which the member is eligible before they can  receive an assignment under the 7 month retainability exception. (T-1) Example:  An enlisted member  with 5 months service retainability from DEROS to date of separation who is eligible to extend for only  an additional 5 months (their maximum allowable), must extend the full 5 months (total 10 months  retainability), or decline in writing.  The enlisted member will not be permitted to extend just 2 months to  be eligible for PCS under the 7-month retainability exception.   7. Minimum retainability requirement is 6 months.  However, the expectation that members obtain  maximum authorized per HYT up to 24 months retainability, if otherwise eligible, remains.  If due to  short notice assignment, and retainability cannot be obtained at losing location, the members will be  required to obtain retainability at gaining location within 30 days from date arrived station.  There is no  minimum retainability required for members being reassigned as a patient or prisoner.    200  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 6.5.  Enlisted Member Retainability Suspense Delay.  R  U  L  E  A  B  If an enlisted member requests a delay  in obtaining retainability and the  reason is:  Then, the MPF Chief or designated authority may grant  an extension of suspense to (see note 1, note 2 and note  3):   1  To reduce obligated service which would  be deducted from a Selective  Reenlistment Bonus  Not later than the 25th day of the 7th month before DEROS  for enlisted member assigned overseas who will not serve  an in-place consecutive overseas tour, or not later than 15  calendar days before enlisted member departs on PCS or  enters an in-place consecutive overseas tour, or the last day  of selective reenlistment bonus eligibility, whichever is  earlier (see note 4).  2  For quality control reasons (see note 5)  Not later than 15 calendar days after the enlisted member  becomes eligible for PCS but not later than 60 days prior to  the projected departure date, or the effective date of an in- place consecutive overseas tour, whichever is earlier.     3  For a first-term Airman or Guardian with  CAREERS retraining  The date of award of the 3-skill level (see note 6).  4  The enlisted member is on TDY or leave  Not later than 15 calendar days after return to their  permanent duty station (for TDY of more than 60 days,  forward documents and require the member to obtain  retainability at the TDY location).  5  For an extended long overseas tour (first- term Airman and Guardian only)  Allow retainability for a portion of the extended tour (only)  to be obtained after arrival overseas (see note 7).  6  Sell leave in conjunction with  reenlistment (career enlisted Airmen and  Guardians only)     90 days before ETS but not later than 120 calendar days  before RNLTD or effective date of in-place consecutive  overseas tour, whichever is earlier.     7  To apply for voluntary retirement which  coincides with the member’s current  DEROS (see note 8)  Not later than the 25th day of the 7th month before current  DEROS or not later than 15 days after denial of the request,  whichever is earlier.  Note:   1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 6.28.8.  2. Do not grant a delay:   a. Beyond the date an enlisted member desires to use allowances.   b. For enlisted members permanently ineligible to obtain full retainability.   c. For circumstances not shown above (example:  members who are HYT restricted, etc.).  3. Enlisted members assigned overseas must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of  receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. (T-1) Delays to this requirement are not  considered unless rule 1 or 7 applies (see notes 4 and 8).  A delay may be granted in obtaining full consecutive  overseas tour or in-place consecutive overseas tour retainability only for one of the reasons shown in the table.  4. A delay may be granted to reduce selective reenlistment bonus impact, but it may not be possible within the  parameters authorized for delays to eliminate impact entirely.  See DAFI 36-2606 when assignment is in an  additionally awarded selective reenlistment bonus AFSC/SFSC and the enlisted member desires to reenlist in  the selective reenlistment bonus AFSC/SFSC for PCS retainability.  Example:  A member is assigned to  Randolph AFB and is selected for reassignment to Osan AB and has an approved FO assignment to Hickam  AFB.  The member has the 12 months retainability.  This amount satisfies the requirement for Osan, but he  needs 36 months retainability for Hickam.  The member has a selective reenlistment bonus.  The member can  request a delay up to 15 days before departing Randolph but must have the 36 months retainability before   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  201  R  U  L  E  A  B  If an enlisted member requests a delay  in obtaining retainability and the  reason is:  Then, the MPF Chief or designated authority may grant  an extension of suspense to (see note 1, note 2 and note  3):   departing or the FO will be canceled.    5. A delay for quality control reasons can only be granted if the enlisted member already had an assignment  prior to the quality control conditions.  6. Enlisted members assigned overseas must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of  receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. (T-1) Delays to this requirement are not  considered.  Enlisted members must extend their enlistment the maximum in accordance with DAFI 36-2606  if they either cannot reenlist in their present AFSC/SFSC or desire to reenlist in their retraining AFSC/SFSC  (which is a selective reenlistment bonus skill). (T-1) For reenlistment at an enroute TDY training site, the  losing unit commander must obtain concurrence of the TDY unit commander to reenlist the enlisted member  at the training site (last training site when there are more than one). (T-1) Do not permit departure from the  last training site without the full prescribed PCS retainability.  If an enlisted member does not reenlist upon  completion of a training course, hold the enlisted member at the training site and notify the assignment OPR  responsible for the training into AFSC/SFSC, AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO, and the losing MPF within 3  calendar days after course completion and provide a report of the circumstances.  Disposition instructions are  provided by the assignment OPR within 5 calendar days.  7. Grant first-term Airman or Guardian ineligible to reenlist because of insufficient time in service to request a  Career Job Reservation (CJR), a delay to obtain retainability for a portion of the Extended Long Overseas  Tour length.  At the time of initial PCS notification, the member must extend the maximum in accordance  with DAFI 36-2606 and having extended, then have at least the required service retainability to serve the  minimum prescribed DoD standard tour length (see PDTATAC AP-TL-01, https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/). (T-0) The DAF Form 899, which orders reassignment of  members selected under this program, must reflect both the correct total number of months the member will  serve as an extended long tour volunteer, and the fact that the member was selected as an extended tour  volunteer.  Example:  a first term Airman or Guardian selected as an extended long tour volunteer for  reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to serve a total of 48  months.  Even though the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel- Regulations/Supplements/) reflects a tour length of 36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the  correct entry for block 11 on the DAF Form 899 is “48” (JTR tour length of 36 plus the 12 months as an  Extended Long Overseas Tour (ELT) volunteer).  In addition, item 12, ELT will reflect an “X” to indicate the  member volunteered for, was selected for, and will serve the ELT (assignment action reason is AO, extended  tour volunteer”).  Also include the following statement in item 24 (Remarks) of the DAF Form 899, ""Approval  granted to delay obtaining (indicate number) months service retainability for a portion of the extended  (indicate accompanied or unaccompanied) tour according to Chapter 2, paragraph 6.28.""  Upon approval of the  delay, the losing MPF updates ALC ""8"" with an expiration date equal to the projected tour completion date for  the full prescribed tour.  The gaining MPF verifies this update upon the member's arrival and corrects as  necessary.  When the member's date of separation is updated as a result of reenlistment, the DEROS  automatically changes to reflect the full prescribed extended tour length.  This is important as the gaining MPF  uses the DAF Form 899 as the source document to award initial DEROS (standard (accompanied or  unaccompanied) tour length plus 12 months).  See DAFMAN 36-2102 and the Orders Processing Application  execution guidance in the myFSS website for further guidance in accomplishing the DAF Form 899.  8. Member’s request for voluntary retirement should be submitted within 30 days of DEROS forecast.  The  MPF does not need to report delays approved under this rule as they do not purge until the member is within 8  months of current DEROS.  Once a member has an assignment selection date any retirement request is  submitted under 7-day option rules.   202  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 6.6.

(T-1)   3. For officers, as an exception, select a volunteer if the officer provides a written statement  indicating understanding that their DEROS is involuntarily extended to match their mandatory  date of separation or mandatory retirement date.  In this case, the officer separates or retires  upon completion of the involuntarily extended overseas tour.  4. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, are ineligible for PCS selection if  upon completion of an unaccompanied short tour, they are subject to involuntary DEROS  extension due to HYT restriction.  For PCS selection, AFPC/DPM is the USAF waiver  authority and ETMO is the USSF wavier authority.  5. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether the  enlisted member has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to  be eligible for selection. (T-1) AFPC is the USAF waiver authority and ETMO is the USSF  waiver authority.  The intent of a retainability requirement beyond completion of the  unaccompanied overseas tour length is either to ensure the enlisted member can obtain the  required retainability to receive a CONUS PCS after an unaccompanied overseas tour and  preclude involuntary extension of an unaccompanied tour due to lack of PCS retainability, or  to ensure adequate retainability to allow election of an accompanied tour.  The retainability  requirement beyond tour completion is not intended to preclude an involuntary DEROS  extension due to lack of PCS retainability for enlisted members who are serving an  accompanied tour.  The accompanied tour length is not always 12 months more than the  unaccompanied tour (e.g., 24/15-month tours), so eligibility for selection uses the  accompanied tour length for 24/12 tours, OR the unaccompanied tour length plus 12 months  for 24/15 tours.  Example:  for a 24/15 tour, the accompanied tour is 9 months longer than the  unaccompanied tour, but CONUS PCS retainability required is 12 months.  Therefore, to be  eligible for selection without knowing which tour a person will elect, they must have or be  able to obtain 27 months total retainability.  6. Career enlisted members, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether the  enlisted member has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to  be eligible for selection. (T-1) AFPC/DPM is the waiver authority.   7. Consider a first-term Airman or Guardian with an approved CJR as a career enlisted  Airman or Guardian for retainability for overseas PCS selection.  8. Initial ETS is the completion of the enlisted member’s initial enlistment with no extensions.  9. AFPC/DPM must approve selection for PCS of an enlisted member when, upon completion  of an unaccompanied overseas short tour the enlisted member would have less than 7 months  PCS retainability. (T-1)   10. Members must be able to obtain retainability, regardless of marital status or whether  members have dependents, to allow members to elect the accompanied tour length or to  request command sponsorship if they acquire dependents.

7.1,2,7,['7'],"Overseas General Information.  Mission sensitivities, coupled with the overseas  environment, require assignment of members whose qualifications, performance, and conduct  meet established DAF standards.  This chapter supplements the general policies and procedures  prescribed elsewhere in this instruction and contains guidance applicable to overseas tour lengths,  management of members while assigned overseas, and actions in conjunction with overseas tour  completion.  Members will not be assigned to active duty on land outside the U.S. and its territories  or possessions until they have completed Air Force or Space Force basic training requirements.  In  time of war or national emergency declared by Congress or the President, the period of required  basic training (to include specialty training immediately following basic training), or its equivalent,  shall not be less than 12 weeks.  Members must be at least 18 years of age to be assigned to a  hostile fire or imminent danger area (See Table 3.2.).  DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A designates  those areas which are hostile fire or imminent danger areas (T-0)",
7.2,2,7,['7'],"Overseas Tour Lengths.  Overseas tour lengths prescribed by DoD are normally based on  quality-of-life conditions with long tour locations usually comparing favorably to U.S. standards.   Normally all members assigned to a location serve the prescribed tour length, regardless of the  military Service in which they serve.  However, there are exceptions and most of these are shown  below or are listed by location in the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/).  Also, overseas tour lengths members  serve can be affected by choices members are authorized to make as outlined in paragraph 7.11.   Members performing duty at a permanent duty station which has a different tour length than that  of their parent organization or a different tour length than the location of the manpower  authorization to which assigned (see paragraph 1.2 and 3.4 for additional guidance), will serve the  tour length applicable to their permanent duty station. (T-1) In accordance with DoDI 1315.18 the  standard tour length for members stationed OCONUS is 36 months accompanied and 24 months  unaccompanied (except for Alaska and Hawaii), unless the Air Force or Space Force provides  conclusive evidence to the DoD that tours at specific locations should be shorter because of the  lack of support facilities.  The tour length (for assignment planning purposes) is 36 months  accompanied  and  24  months  unaccompanied  if  the  PDTATAC  AP-TL-01  (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/)  does not specify a tour length for a location.  Accompanied by dependent tours and command  sponsorship of dependents are permitted only when government family quarters or government  approved family quarters and support facilities are available to the member.  When a tour length  of less than 36/24 is requested, before selection of members for PCS, the Assignment OPR must  obtain tour length approval from DoD according to paragraph 7.2.1 below, or by SecAF when  the guidance in paragraph 7.2.3 applies. (T-0)",
7.2.1,3,7.2,"['7', '7.2']","Request to Establish or Change Overseas Tour Lengths.  The DoD is the approval  authority for establishment of, or changes to, overseas tour lengths, except those described in  paragraph 7.2.3.  Requests to establish a tour length or change to the DoD prescribed tour  lengths reflected in the PDTATAC AP-TL-01 (https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy- Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/Supplements/), require the coordination of the  Services affected and are submitted by the Unified Commander concerned, through the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  225  Readiness), for final decision. DoDI 1315.18 contains specific site survey data and other  information required as justification for the requested tour length.

This is very important when the overseas PCS selection  criteria changes from long to short, or vice versa.  Because of commitments to FO  assignments, etc., it may not be possible in all cases to preclude any impact on members  who are projected for assignment.  Similarly, whenever possible, a tour length change  should exclude those members currently assigned unless it is clearly appropriate to include  them.  Establishing a tour length change effective date which affects members already  selected for assignment or currently assigned can create turmoil, hardship, stress on  families and members, and generate additional PCS costs.",

In some instances, tour lengths are specified by DoD based  on duty to be performed or category of members rather than being based on the normal tour  length criteria which is quality of life conditions.  Also, for some assignments, DoD has  approved DAF’s request for exception to the normal prescribed tour length.  The assignment  instructions or other guidance identifies the tour length to be served in conjunction with the  assignment.  When a tour length is based on criteria other than normal quality of life criteria  (such as duty to be performed, category of members, or the tour length for members is an  exception), such tours are not prorated (also see paragraph 7.8.).  Requests for tour length  exceptions (those which are not based on quality-of-life conditions at a location, such as, for  Professional Military Education (PME), formal education, in conjunction with training, a  school, scholarship, fellowship or grant, and so on) may be submitted per paragraph 5.5 for  consideration and approval by the appropriate level.  Adequate time should be allowed to  permit the exception request to be submitted to DoD for consideration.  When it is known that  the duration of an assignment is less than the normal prescribed tour length for an overseas  location, then either a request for overseas tour length exception is requested and approved in  advance, or curtailment of the tour length prescribed for the location is requested and approved  as an exception per paragraph 5.5.

Credit for overseas service begins on member’s date of arrival at the new overseas  station for a member with approved leave in an overseas area prior to reporting to a new overseas  duty station.

When a member has leave approved in an overseas area after completion of an overseas tour, then  credit for overseas service ends upon departure from the current overseas duty station.  As  explained below, “award” of an overseas service date means to give the member a new date equal  to the completion date of the last TDY performed in a cumulative TDY period which qualifies for  award of a new date.  Example:  a member who has never served overseas has a TAFMSD and  ODSD of 10 Sep 2000.

An “adjustment” of an overseas service date is  adding the number of days a member was in TDY status to a previously awarded date.  Example:   a member serving in the CONUS last returned from PCS overseas on 25 Sep 2003 (ODSD is 25  Sep 2003) and the member performs 5 days TDY overseas from 1 Feb 2005 through 5 Feb 2005.

Example:  a member with an RNLTD of 30 Jun 2008 who departs  the CONUS on 20 Jun 2008 to serve a 36-month tour would have a DEROS of 20 Jun 2011.   A member with an RNLTD of 10 Sep 2008 who departs the CONUS on 1 Sep 2008 to serve a  12-month tour would have a DEROS of 1 Sep 2009.  A member with an RNLTD of 10 Feb  2008 who departs the CONUS on 31 January 2008 and arrives on 1 Feb 2008 to serve a 12- month tour would have a DEROS of 1 Feb 2009 (this member should not have departed the  CONUS prior to the DEROS month according to Table 7.4 and paragraphs 6.31 and 6.32.  No  other method is used to compute the DEROS except when member is authorized to report prior  to their RNLTD month.  In those instances, DEROS is computed by adding the overseas tour  length to the RNLTD month.  The DEROS is updated per the execution guidance in the myFSS  website.  The DEROS for general officers (and selectees) is established or adjusted at the  discretion of the SecAF.  On arrival of a general officer or selectee at the overseas duty station,  the DEROS is established as shown in Table 7.4, or based on assignment instructions from the  assignment OPR.  AFPC does not change the DEROS of general officers (or selectees) once  initially established.  Send DEROS change requests out of system to AF/A1LG (USAF) or  SF/S1L (USSF) for approval and reentry into the PDS.  For all members, when PCS orders  show the member elected the accompanied tour, the initial DEROS is based on the  accompanied tour length, whether the member arrives with dependents.

Overseas tour proration  recognizes overseas service at one location in proportion to overseas service at another location  with a different tour length.  Proration in conjunction with PCS is a DAF policy, except DoD may  authorize or direct proration in some instances in conjunction with a change of overseas tour length  affecting members currently assigned.  When proration is authorized (and not prohibited, see  paragraph 7.2), a member’s current overseas tour (DEROS) could either be lengthened or  shortened depending on the circumstances.  Proration may be based on when reassigned PCS to  another overseas location with a different tour length before completing the full prescribed  overseas tour at the initial location; when a tour length is changed at the member’s duty station  during a member’s overseas tour; or as determined by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.  Proration  may be suspended, or an individual request disapproved when approval does not serve the best  interests of the DAF.  Enlisted members serving an OTEIP extension (AAC 77) are not eligible  for tour proration.  When a member is reassigned to an overseas location with a different tour  length than the one currently being served, or a tour length is changed and the implementation date  affects members currently assigned, then the overseas tour is not normally prorated (longer or  shorter) unless the individual assignment instructions or tour length implementation guidance  affords the member options or prohibits proration.  Example:  implementation guidance for a  change of current tour from a shorter to longer tour may contain the option for members currently  assigned to retain the current (shorter) tour or voluntarily serve the longer tour, or it may require  serving the longer tour as mandatory or may stipulate proration from the shorter to the longer tour.

Proration of DEROS  to less than 6 months remaining is not authorized when a tour length change occurs and the member  is remaining in place unless an exception is granted by AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO.  This  allows adequate time for all action related to PCS to occur in a timely manner.

Citizenship is the  relationship between a person and a country under which the person owes allegiance and is  entitled to protection by the country.

The only source document to be used to validate overseas TDY is a copy of the paid travel  voucher for each TDY claimed.  6. Credit for 2 days or more TDY began on 5 Jan 95.  For TDYs prior to this date members  needed to serve a cumulative total or 90 or more days in a consecutive 3 year period to earn  an adjustment to the ODSD/short tour return date.  7. Use country code ""ZT"" with a tour length of number of days served for the PDS update.   8. Members who are officially categorized via DD Form 1300 receive credit for at least one  short tour, regardless of the length of time served overseas.  Additional short tour credit is  awarded in 12 month increments, and any portion thereof, at the time of release/return to U.S.  control.  9.

Countries  comprising the area of responsibility are: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, United Arab Emirates  (UAE), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Yemen, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the airspace  and adjacent waters of these countries.  10. For overseas tour crediting purposes, for this TDY only, begin credit with the day of  arrival in the area of responsibility and end with the day of departure from the area of  responsibility.  11. Overseas tour length is updated to 12 months provided member meets minimum award  criteria.  Those members previously awarded short tour credit under the temporary 181-day  guidelines keep their short tour credit.  Members arriving in the area of responsibility prior to  1 Jul 11 and serving at least 181 days in a hostile fire or imminent danger pay area receive  short tour credit under the previous criteria.  Those arriving in the area of responsibility on or  after 1 Jul 11 do not receive short tour credit under the 181-day guidelines.         276  DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  Table 7.7.

Unit  commanders have disapproval  authority.  When the commander  recommends approval, the MPF  sends to the assignment OPR.   Assignment OPR approves or  disapproves and advises the MPF.  2  Service member’s  request for DEROS to  coincide with date of  separation or desired  retirement date  3    Service member’s  request due to pregnancy  of civilian spouse and the  recommendation of  attending physician  60 calendar days or less  Installation commander (may be  delegated to the Group or  Squadron Commander) or  ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint  bases may approve (see note 3).  4  More than 60 calendar days  See note 3.  5  Service member’s  request, female service  member is pregnant and  the attending physician  recommends  60 calendar days of less  Installation commander (may be  delegated to the Group or  Squadron Commander) or  ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint  bases may approve (see note 3).  6  More than 60 calendar days  See note 3.  Notes:    1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 7.5.6.  Commanders may not disapprove a  voluntary extension request based solely on a service member’s assignment overseas for an  arbitrary maximum period of time.  However, commanders may disapprove extension requests  based on a requirement for fresh expertise or for reasons such as job stress, personal or family  hardship, lack of adequate medical or educational facilities, etc.  2. Normal voluntary DEROS extension criteria do not apply to a member’s request for change of  overseas tour status from unaccompanied to accompanied.  Approval of command sponsorship  and change of overseas tour status requires the service member to serve the accompanied tour  length.  Therefore, the DEROS change action is an adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 7.4  (not a voluntary extension action), also see paragraph 7.11.  3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks after estimated delivery date.  Establish new DEROS  as one day after TRD.  If new DEROS is 60 days or less from old DEROS, the installation  commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may approve extension.  If new DEROS  exceeds 60 days from old DEROS, forward request to the assignment OPR.  In the case of  military couples, the installation commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may approve  up to a 60 calendar day extension of tour for both service members as long as the new DEROS of  both service members is within the same month.  The commander must notify the MPF  immediately so they can make the necessary changes to DEROS and other adjusted suspense.  (T-1)    DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  277  Table 7.8.

In the case of military couples, the installation  commander or ABG/CC at non-AF led Joint bases may only approve curtailment of the  pregnant service member.  Submit a request to curtail the spouse, depending on period of  curtailment.  Enlisted service members who have extension to overseas tour approved under the  OTEIP are not eligible for curtailment (except for pregnant service members at dependent- restricted locations).  These service members may extend their DEROS beyond the travel  restriction date or request early return of civilian spouse.  In accordance with AFI 44-102,  Medical Care Management, pregnant service members assigned to isolated or remote areas  without appropriate obstetrical care will have their assignment curtailed by the 24th week of  pregnancy or earlier.  If local medical personnel are not capable of managing the early  complications of pregnancy or the pregnancy is complicated, the service member’s assignment  shall be immediately curtailed.  The commander must immediately notify the MPF so they can  make the necessary changes to DEROS and other suspenses. (T-1)   4. See paragraph 7.7.  5. When manning will not support extending the military spouse with the earlier DEROS in  their AFSC/SFSC or when the military spouse was curtailed due to operational necessity such  as force closure action within the unit assigned.  This rule does not apply when a change of  DEROS was the result of a service member’s request for the change such as cancellation of all  or partial voluntary extensions of an overseas tour.  6. Request for CONUS assignment is sent via CMS to the AFPC (RegAF) or ETMO (USSF)  OPR responsible for a service member’s AFSC/SFSC (see Table 2.1) with information copy to  the Air Force Military Justice and Policy Division (JA/JAJM), JB Andrews AFB, MD. Request  includes date confinement ends and home of record.  7. See paragraph 6.45.  Curtailment as a result of surplus based on promotion permitted only  when the promotion is to the grade of SMSgt (USSF only), CMSgt, or colonel.  8. The assignment OPR may approve cancellation (provided it is not an OTEIP extension) if the  new DEROS does not place the enlisted service member in the overseas or overseas returnee  cycle (see Attachment 13 Table A13.1. allocations column) and for officers, the new DEROS  cannot result in an assignment selection date which is past (see Table 6.7, rule 3 for assignment  selection date schedule).  This does not apply to an enlisted service member serving an  extended long tour unless cancellation requested is to an extension of the ELT.  Requests  involving OTEIP extensions are submitted to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO as exceptions  according to paragraph 5.5.  9.

Other factors, to include the Guardian Ideal  principles of an individualized approach to talent management and placement based on best fit,  may be considered.  3. Each returnee is aligned within their grouping and within each grade and AFSC/SFSC, and  further grouped by number of short tours previously served (this does not include the current  tour).  Members possessing the most number of short tours receive higher priority.  When the  number of short tours is equal for two or more returnees, higher priority within each group is  given to members who voluntarily extended their tour for a period of 6 or more months in a  short tour area or 12 months in a long tour area (OTEIP extension of tour).  Higher priority is  not given when an extension was for the purpose of command sponsoring dependents (because  this is a change in tour election and not an extension).  Additionally, each month extended  beyond the 6 or 12 month minimum raises the member’s priority.  In the event of a tie within a  priority group, members are matched in the following order:  Grade (highest grade takes precedence).  Example:  a MSgt will receive higher priority over a  MSgt selectee.  Date of Rank (DOR) (earliest date takes precedence);   Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (Officers only, when applicable per note  1) (earliest date takes precedence);   Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) (earliest date takes precedence);   Date of Birth (DOB) (earliest date takes precedence);   Reverse Social Security Number (SSN) order (use all 9 digits and lowest number takes  precedence).  Example:  if the SSN is 123-45-6789 as a normal number it would be  123,456,789, and reversed it would 987,654,321.  4. CMMs are aligned into the fourth priority group after overseas returnees within each grade  and AFSC/SFSC, and further grouped by Date Arrived Station, DOR, TAFMSD, and then  DOB.  5.

Overgrade expiration dates may not exceed 2 years from date the condition began or 2 years  from current expiration date for revalidated waivers except as specified in Column E.  In the unit  program for lieutenant colonel and major where two grades overgrade conditions exist, HQ  AFRC/CD is the approval authority and will determine the expiration date.  Forward all waiver  requests through command channels to HQ AFRC/A1K or AF/REG (for colonels) for staffing to  HQ AFRC/CD for approval/disapproval.  Waivers may be processed via TMT provided all  required information is provided.  Any requirements for exception to policy must include all  required information as outlined in paragraph 9.7.4.  If there are questions concerning  processing requirements contact HQ AFRC/A1KK for further processing instructions.  Within  the IR portfolio HQ RIO/CC is the approval authority.     2. Every effort must be made to assign lieutenant colonels and majors to valid authorizations.    Line Officers:  First-time single overgrade waivers may be approved by the RSG, detached  group commander (unit program) or HQ RIO Det/CC (IR portfolio) not to exceed 2 years.  The  RSG, NAF, Wing, detached group commander or HQ RIO Det/CC may revalidate this waiver  for an additional 1 year based on critical mission needs. HQ AFRC/CD (unit program) or HQ  RIO/CC (IR portfolio) approval is required for fourth year waivers based on critical mission  needs.  All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD approval must be processed as listed in note 1.    Non-Line Officers:  Non-line officers may be initially placed in code “P” for 2 years if  approved by the wing commander. The wing commander may revalidate this waiver in 2-year  increments.    The appropriate central manager (HQ AFRC/HC, HQ AFRC/SG, SAF/IAS) will approve IRs.   ART Line Officers:  ART line officers who have not attained civil service retirement eligibility  for an immediate annuity, require biannual waivers approved by their wing commander until  they are placed in a non-overgrade status, or attain retirement eligibility.  Retention of an ART in  an overgrade status beyond their civil service retirement date requires an approved waiver by HQ  AFRC/CD the first year and AF/RE for subsequent years.  All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD  approval must be processed as listed in note 1.   3. Two grades overgrade.  Two grades overgrade is only authorized in accordance with  paragraph 9.7 and PDS code “T” applies.  Members may be initially placed in code “T” for 2  years if approved by the wing commander.  All reevaluations for enlisted personnel for  additional time must be approved by the appropriate commander in 2 year increments.   Additionally, any requirement to place lieutenant colonels or majors against positions causing  two grades or more overgrade condition requires HQ AFRC/CD or HQ ARPC/DPA approval.   All waivers requiring HQ AFRC/CD or HQ ARPC/DPA approval must be processed as listed in  note 1.   4. See paragraph 9.1.1.      DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  341  Table 9.4.  Overage Codes.

9.7.10,3,9.7,"['9', '9.7']",")   Notes:   1. Overage code will be updated on the incumbent who is leaving the position. When used for  training mission enhancement reasons, this code is used for Unit Training Assembly induced  workload as well as units with physical exam responsibilities.     2. Commanders may utilize this overage provision to place members transitioning from AGR  (Headquarters or Unit) tours, ART positions, or the Retired Reserve.  It applies to officers  (lieutenant colonel and below) and enlisted members (SMSgt and below) and seeks to prevent the  loss of valuable personnel because of relocation.  The gaining NAF, RSG, wing, detached group  commander or HQ RIO Det/CC has approval authority.  Personnel relocating within a commuting  area or asking to change assignments within a commuting area are ineligible with the exception of  AGR and ART personnel.  During this period overages will not count towards promotion  opportunities. Overage periods are not to exceed the member’s MSO or 2 years from effective date  of change of strength accountability, whichever is greater.  Additional information is located in  paragraph 9.3.     3. Once the overage code is withdrawn the member is reassigned to HQ ARPC, or retired, if  eligible.  Efficient facilities initiatives/force reduction enlisted overages do not affect promotion  opportunities for incumbent members, however, officer overages do.  Officers will be tracked as  overage code “4.”     4. Approval of colonel actions will be routed through AF/REG and approved by HQ AFRC/CD  (unit) or (line IRs). The appropriate central manager (HQ AFRC/HC, AF/JA, HQ AFRC/SG,   DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  343  R   U   L   E   A   B   C   D   E   If Reason For  Overage Is   Use   Overage   Code   Grade   Update   Authority   Expiration Date   SAF/IAS) will approve their O-6 actions.  Rated positions may be included in this authority against  anticipated losses as long as the overage can be eliminated within a single 2-year increment.     5. This code is used during the period to attain/maintain C rating/wartime shortfall.  HQ RIO  Det/CCs who have reached their FY funded allocation may assign an individual as an overage.     6. For the IR portfolio, the code “4” will also be used to identify individuals that are hired when a  command has executed its FY Defense Program authorization.  This restricts these over-manning  overages to Maj/MSgt and below.  Commands who wish to pursue an exception to this grade  restriction must submit justification to HQ RIO/CC (see paragraph 9.7.9.1.3).     7.

17.1,2,17,['17'],"Purpose.  10 USC § 12686(a), Reserves on Active Duty within Two Years of Retirement  Eligibility: Limitation on Release from Active Duty and § 12646(e), Commissioned Officers:  Retention of After Completion of 18 Years or More, but Less Than 20 Years of Service establish  an active duty retirement sanctuary for members of all Air Reserve Components. A member of a  Reserve component who is on active duty (other than for training), who is within two years of  becoming eligible for retired pay or retainer pay under a purely military retirement system may  not be involuntarily released from that duty before member becomes eligible for that pay, except  as provided by this chapter. The sanctuary statute does not deny anyone their entitlement to a 20- year retirement; members may continue to accrue active duty points while performing any  voluntary tour of active duty with a signed/approved waiver in place.",
17.2,2,17,['17'],Definition.  Active duty sanctuary protection begins with 18 years of Total Active Federal  Military Service (TAFMS) and ends with 20 years of TAFMS.  It provides a member with a limited  entitlement to remain on active duty for the purpose of qualifying for an active duty military  retirement.,
17.3,2,17,['17'],"Guidance.  In general, active duty sanctuary means any ANG or AFR officer/enlisted  member who attains 18 (but less than 20) years of TAFMS must be retained on active duty unless  they: voluntarily separated; are medically disqualified for continued service; or are  separated/discharged for cause. (T-1) All active duty time served counts for the computation of  the 18 years of TAFMS required toward reaching the sanctuary zone.  If a member is not on a  sanctuary waiver and desires to invoke sanctuary protection under 10 USC § 12686(a), they must  claim such protection while on active duty orders (other than for training) and while in the  sanctuary zone. (T-0) The request must be in writing and submitted in accordance with ANG or  AFR program directives for processing. (T-1) Absent a written claim for sanctuary zone  protection, the component will consider the member’s release from active duty as voluntary and  sanctuary protection will be deemed not properly requested.

Each member of a military  couple is serving in their own right.  This means military couples fulfill the obligations inherent to  all members and they are considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and  perform duties which require the skills in which they are trained and experienced subject to their  PCS eligibility.  Provided this criteria is met, military couples may be considered for an assignment  where they can maintain a joint residence.  The assignment of military couples is also referred as  a join spouse assignment. Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family separation.   They should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based  on the assumption they can always be assigned to the same location or join spouse assignment is  guaranteed.  Military couples, like members with a civilian spouse, should expect periods of  separation during their careers.

I, _______________________________, having accumulated at least 16 ½ years, but less  than 20 years Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS), understand that I am in or nearing  the active duty sanctuary zone, as defined by Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 36- 2110, Total Force Assignments, paragraph 17.4.1.1.1.    2.  If my voluntary active duty orders (Title 10 or Title 32, not for training) are for less than 180  days, I am waiving the right to claim sanctuary protection.  However, if my orders are extended  past 180 days and places me beyond 18 years TAFMS, I understand that I have the right to claim  active duty sanctuary protection.  However, I acknowledge that I may be reassigned in  accordance with the needs and priorities of the Air Force Reserve, and such assignment  terminates upon reaching eligibility for an immediate active duty retirement, in accordance with  DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.6.1.  Continued service beyond this Final Tour is not a right and is  based upon the member finding an acceptable position in the Selected Reserve, in accordance  with DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.12    3. By signing below, I acknowledge this statement of understanding will remain in effect until I  have reached 20 years of Total Active Federal Military Service and will be kept on file in my  master personnel record, in accordance with DAFI 36-2110, paragraph 17.8.2.  This SOU does  not need to be re-accomplished with new orders.

I support the action of (Requestor) to waive his/her sanctuary protection to perform the above  voluntary tour of active duty.     2. I understand that in order for me to serve on active duty during the period specified above,  which would bring me within the sanctuary protection, the SecAF requires that I must waive  my right to sanctuary protection, in accordance with 10 USC § 12686(b).    3. This waiver, shown by my signature below, means I will not receive sanctuary protection.  Therefore, I may be released from active duty without SecAF approval even though serving on  active duty within two years of becoming eligible for retired pay.    4. I also understand no order request submitted requiring me to perform further voluntary  active duty service is effective until this waiver is acknowledged and tour approved by The  Adjunct General or designee.

I understand that by waiving my right to claim sanctuary I am allowed to perform a  voluntary Title 32 Active Duty for Operation Support, Special Training or Title 10 Military  Personnel Appropriation tour of less than 180 days (number of days shown on the military  orders to which this waiver relates, cannot be altered upward or that tour extended, by  amendment or otherwise without an additional waiver being executed for the time-period of the  requested extension).  _____ I understand that while performing the approved tour I may not claim sanctuary. I further  understand that should I attempt to claim sanctuary while performing this tour of duty, my orders  may be terminated prior to the end of the tour.  I understand that for each type of active duty tour or extension thereof that I request, except  Active Duty for Training, a new waiver will be required and accomplished.  _____ I understand that my active duty tour will not begin until I have proper approval from  The Adjunct General or designee.  I understand that I will continue to accrue active duty points while performing this tour with a  waiver in place; upon accumulation of approximately 7305 active duty points, I will have  earned an active duty retirement and may retire immediately with an active duty annuity, or  continue to participate for additional points and pay.  I understand this sanctuary waiver is irrevocable for the voluntary period of active duty for  which the waiver has been requested.     DAFI36-2110  9 AUGUST 2024  523  ______ I understand that this written document will be filed at my State Joint Forces  Headquarters, FSS /Force Support Flights and my unit as evidence that I have waived my  right to sanctuary protection.  ___________________________        _________________________  Member’s Full Signature (Date)        Witness Signature (Date)    1st Ind, Unit Commander Wing Commander  State Joint Forces Headquarters In Turn    I support the action of requestor to waive his sanctuary protection to perform the above  voluntary tour of active duty.    _____________________________   Typed Signature Block and Signature  cc: Individual      This document requires the collection and maintenance of information protected by the Privacy  Act of 1974.
