Chapter 3 
GENERAL GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURES 
3.1. General Information. There are several policies and procedures which apply to assignment  actions and programs. When necessary, in the national interests or the best interests of the DAF,  waivers, exceptions and/or deviations from guidance and procedures in this instruction may be  authorized by proper authority. 
3.2. Equal Opportunity. The DAF manages and assigns members without regard to color, race,  religious preference (except chaplains), national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status  (except military couples), spouse’s employment, educational or volunteer service activities of a  spouse, gender (except as provided for by statute or DoD policy) or sexual orientation. (T-0) The  objective is to ensure fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment of all based on merit, fitness,  capability, and potential. 
3.3. General Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility. Members will not be assigned to active  duty on land outside the U.S. and its territories or possessions until they have completed Air Force  or Space Force basic training requirements, respectively. (T-1) In time of war or national  emergency declared by Congress or the President, the period of required basic training (to include  specialty training immediately following basic training) or its equivalent is not less than 12 weeks. 
3.4. PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). 
3.4.1. Normally, a service member is assigned to a unit to fill a manpower position and  perform duty at the same location as the unit. As a general assignment policy, members are  not permanently assigned (including detailed, attached, etc.) to a location unless a DAF unit  (or Air Force or Space Force element for DoD organizations) has officially been established at  that location. Assignment of members overseas without proper establishment of an DAF unit  at the location where the service member will actually perform duty can create severe problems  (i.e., if no Status of Forces Agreement exists or an existing agreement does not cover a service  member and/or their dependents, the member may encounter pay discrepancies when the rate  of pay and allowances is different at the actual duty station in relation to the location of the  manpower authorization to which the service member may be assigned, etc.). Assignments  contrary to this guidance circumvents the DAF manpower, personnel assignment, and  accountability systems, which can affect a service member’s pay and allowances and have  other serious consequences. 
3.4.2. Other PCSs. Members may be ordered or authorized a PCS for which this instruction  is not the authority. This includes members PCSing upon accession, separation, or retirement,  as a patient, as a prisoner, for administrative actions or boards in connection with judicial  proceedings or for reasons other than those cited in paragraph 3.4.1. When this happens, the  PCS authority, funding authorization, policies, and procedures to be followed should be within  the instruction which requires the PCS. To assist in determining whether or not to request a  PCS in accordance with this instruction or another DAF, Air Force, or Space Force instruction,  use this general test: If the purpose of the PCS is for a service member to fill a funded vacant  manpower authorization and to perform duty in their Air Force Specialty (AFS) or Space Force  Specialty (SFS), the selection was based on individual qualifications, and the PCS eligibility  policies and procedures prescribed in this instruction, then the PCS is within the authority of 
24 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
this instruction. When a PCS is necessary and no DAF, Air Force, or Space Force instruction  authorizes the move, then a request for PCS may be submitted as outlined in paragraph 5.5.  Exceptions: In one way or another, the MPF provides support for all PCSs. Attachment 17 lists reasons, with applicable authorities, for PCS that are outside the authority of this  instruction. 
3.4.2.1. PCA with PCS. A PCA with concurrent PCS is when members physically  perform duty at a location which is the same as the organization to which they are assigned,  and upon reassignment physically perform duty at a new location. 
3.4.2.2. PCA without PCS. 
3.4.2.2.1. A PCA without PCS is when a service member is permanently reassigned  from one organization to another organization with no change of permanent duty  station. 
3.4.2.2.2. When a service member is permanently reassigned from one permanent duty  station to another (that is, the duty location [codes] is different) this is normally a PCS,  except when both locations are within the corporate limits of the same city or town,  then both locations are within the same permanent duty station for PCS allowance  purposes (reference paragraph 6.41.). In such cases, notwithstanding the change of  permanent duty stations, the move is still managed as a PCA without PCS. The rules  for management of PCSs, such as time-on-station and retainability requirements, do  not apply if it is a PCS without PCS allowances. 
3.4.3. PCS without PCA. There are times when it may be necessary to direct members to  physically change stations, but it may not be appropriate to change the unit to which they are  assigned. Example: a service member returning from overseas for normal retirement may be  assigned PCS without PCA to a retirement processing base; the PCS of prisoners to a  confinement facility or between confinement facilities; or PCS or TDY related to judicial  proceedings. Note: In cases of PCS without PCA due to retirement from an overseas location,  the time between departure from the overseas area and actual retirement date, the service  member remains assigned for manning, accountability, and other purposes to their last unit of  assignment overseas. 
3.4.3.1. (RegAF and USSF Only) While the term “assignments” is frequently used to  describe all PCSs, the fact is there are various types of PCS moves directed by OPRs not  within AFPC/DP3, AFPC/DPM, or ETMO, which are made under the authority of another  prescribing instruction. As a reminder, except for patient assignments, assignment OPRs  within the AFPC/DP3, AFPC/DPM, and ETMO are responsible for only operational,  rotational, force structure, and training PCSs. Refer to Attachment 17. 
3.4.3.2. (ARC only) ARC members at a duty location (other than their Base of  Assignment) in excess of 180 days are assigned PCS without PCA unless approved by  SAF/MR or designated representative. (T-1)  
3.5. Minimum Age for Assignment to a Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger Area. Members must  be at least 18 years of age to be assigned (PCS or TDY) to a hostile fire or imminent danger area  as stated in 22 USC § 2370c-1, Prohibition. (T-0) (See Table 3.2, line 20, for associated code.).  The DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR), DoD 7000.14, Vol. 7a, Military Pay 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 25 
Policy-Active Duty and Reserve Pay lists those areas which are hostile fire or imminent danger  areas. 
3.6. Assignment Limitation Codes (ALC). Assignment limitations alert personnel managers of  long-term constraints on utilization of members. These codes limit the selection of members to or  from certain duties or areas and may be permanent or semi-permanent. An Assignment  Availability Code (2910) limits a service member’s duty during an assignment or duty location,  although an ALC may be used by exception. Table 3.2 lists the various types of assignment  limitations and corresponding system update codes. 
3.7. Medical Deferment or Limitation. Worldwide commitments require every service member  to be physically qualified for immediate global reassignment, except as indicated below. 
3.7.1. Temporary Medical Deferment. A service member may be deferred from PCS or TDY  when a temporary medical condition (expected to last less than 12 months) prevents worldwide  service. When an authorized medical official updates a temporary medical deferment, the PDS  automatically processes an AAC 31 (Table 3.1) if the date of availability is 30 calendar days  or more from the date of the AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report. If the date of  availability is less than 30 calendar days, an AAC 31 is not authorized. (T-1) The date of  availability cannot be extended beyond 12 months from the date when the underlying defect  was deemed, or clearly should have been deemed, disqualifying for worldwide duty. (T-1)  When a service member, who is temporarily medically deferred from PCS, is scheduled for a  mandatory PCS, medical officials determine if the service member may proceed on PCS and  be treated at the next duty station or whether the service member should remain at the current  station for continuing medical treatment. If the medical official determines the service member  should remain at the current location, the MPF will reclama the assignment (see paragraph 6.33) upon written notification. (T-1) The assignment OPR will request assistance from the  Medical Standards and Evaluations Branch to determine the appropriate assignment action  based on the medical circumstances (AFPC/DPMNP (RegAF and USSF); AFRC/Chief of  Aerospace Medicine (SGP) (AFR); NGB/SGP (ANG)). (T-1)  
3.7.2. Medical Evaluation Board and Physical Evaluation Board Deferment. Medical  treatment facilities (MTFs) submit an AF Form 469 on members with physical limitations not  of a temporary nature, that interfere with worldwide assignability, to indicate a medical  evaluation board is being processed. The automatic PDS interface updates an AAC 37. If the  service member’s personnel record reflects an AAC 31, Temporary Medical Deferment, the  AAC is automatically removed and replaced with AAC 37, Medical Evaluation Board or  Physical Evaluation Board (see Table 3.1). Per DAFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for  Retention, Retirement and Separation, a service member pending a Medical Evaluation Board  or Physical Evaluation Board may not be reassigned PCS or TDY (or granted leave outside the  local area, separated or retired) until the MTF determines the medical disposition. 
3.7.2.1. (RegAF and USSF) If circumstances arise regarding the assignment status of a  service member pending a medical evaluation board or physical evaluation board, the MPF  will advise the assignment OPR via email and provide complete details (i.e., for a service  member serving overseas, it appears the date eligible for return from overseas (DEROS)  expires before a final determination is made). (T-1) The MPF will provide an information  copy to AFPC/DPMNP and AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO. (T-1) Guidance is provided  as appropriate. Note: An AAC 31 or 37 does not preclude a service member from 
26 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
separating or retiring, therefore these personnel actions should be monitored by other  means. The DEROS is not involuntarily extended for medical reasons. When appropriate  medical authority determines a service member is not medically cleared for PCS and AAC  31 or 37 is updated, the service member is ordered to remain in place and the DEROS is  allowed to expire. When service members are medically cleared for PCS near or after their  DEROS, the MPF advises the assignment OPR, with information copy to AFPC/DPMNP  and AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO, of the circumstances and requests assignment  disposition. 
3.7.2.2. (ARC only) Reserve component members cannot be involuntarily retained on  orders; however, they may receive Medical Continuation (MEDCON) orders or receive  incapacitation pay as specified in AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination.  (T-0) Note: AGR members are not eligible for MEDCON and will (with member’s  consent) remain on orders until medical issue is satisfactorily resolved or final disposition  of the Disability Evaluation System. Reference DoDI 1332.18, Disability Evaluation  System (DES) and DoDI 1241.01, Reserve Component (RC) Line of Duty Determination  for Medical and Dental Treatments and Incapacitation Pay Entitlements. 
3.8. Dependent Care. All members must ensure care of their dependents when separated due to  TDY or PCS. (T-0) Members who cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family  needs are considered for separation or, if eligible, may be given an opportunity to apply for  immediate retirement. 
3.8.1. Military Couples with Dependents and Single Service Members Sponsors. Dependent  care plan requirements are prescribed by DoDI 1342.19_AFI36-2908, Family Care Plans.  When a service member has a questionable dependent care plan, commanders require the  service member to develop a workable plan. To assist, commanders may consider approving  leave for the service member and, as necessary, direct the service member to receive counseling  on the criteria for humanitarian reassignment or deferment or hardship discharge depending on  the duration and severity of the problem. If the service member cannot or does not develop an  adequate dependent care plan, the commander will process the service member for discharge  in accordance with applicable directives or, if eligible, may be given an opportunity to apply  for immediate retirement. (T-1)  
3.8.2. Service Member Adopting Children. 
3.8.2.1. Service members may be authorized deferment from PCS or TDY after a child is  officially placed in the home as part of the official adoption process. A single service  member sponsor or one service member of a military couple may request up to a six-month  deferment from assignment to an overseas location if concurrent travel is denied  (regardless of the tour length) or where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18  months, and the service member is not permitted to serve the accompanied-by-dependents  tour. The intent is to avoid involuntary separation of the service member and child to  facilitate bonding. When a child has been in the service member’s home for some time  prior to the official adoption process or a bonding period is not necessary for other reasons,  the service member may decide not to request a six-month deferment. As necessary,  Commanders, Senior Enlisted Leaders, First Sergeants, and/or Military Personnel Section  personnel counsel the service member on humanitarian assignment or deferment options 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 27 
as outlined in Attachment 15. This six-month deferment is separate from any other  humanitarian deferment the service member may be granted in connection with adoption. 
3.8.2.2. Members who qualify for and desire the six-month deferment must provide a  statement from adoption authorities, endorsed by the unit commander, confirming the date  the member initiated formal adoption proceedings and the date the child was officially  placed in the member’s home incident to the adoption application. (T-1) Commanders may  request assistance from the servicing legal office if any question exists on the adequacy of  the statement or eligibility of a member under this paragraph. Deferments are not approved  in advance of placement of a child in the member’s home as described above. 
3.8.2.3. The MPF updates ALC “S,” Adoption Deferment (see Table 3.2), upon  Commander (or designated representative) approval. 
3.9. High Year of Tenure (Enlisted Only) (Does not apply to ANG ). Reenlistment or  extension of enlistment beyond the limits established in DAFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, are  not authorized except for documented cases of hardship. (T-1)  
3.10. Assignment of Enlisted Aircrew (RegAF and ARC only). Enlisted members who are  career aviators are selected and reassigned in their aircrew AFSC only. Career aviators are those  AFSCs that require aviation service as a mandatory specialty qualification according to the Air  Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), DAFMAN 11-401, Aviation Management, and  Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service. Career aviators are those  aircrew members who perform full-time aircrew duties in AFSCs 1AX/1UX or Special Duty  Identifiers (SDI) in accordance with AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. The same requirements  apply for IR members that are in non-flying 1AX/1UX assignments. 
3.11. Assignment of Rated Personnel. All officers assigned to rated positions must hold the  aeronautical rating required for the position to which assigned in accordance with DAFMAN 11- 401. (T-3)  
3.12. Assignment of Chaplains (RegAF and ARC only). Officers assigned as chaplains must  hold 52X AFSC, possess ecclesiastical endorsements listed in Department of Defense DoDI  1304.28, The Appointment and Service of Chaplains,” published 12 May 2021, and be accepted  by United States Air Force, Chief of Air Force Chaplains (AF/HC). (T-0) ANG-specific chaplain  assignments can be found in DAFMAN 36-2032. 
3.13. Assignment to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant Positions (ARC  Only). 
3.13.1. (ANG Only) Prior to the assignment action, TAG or CG must approve the assignment  of a member to a SMSgt or CMSgt position who is two or more grades below that authorized.  (T-2)  
3.13.2. (ARC Only) Members must meet all promotion eligibility requirements in DAFI 36- 2502, Enlisted Airman Promotion and Demotion Programs, Table 8.2, prior to placement into  a higher graded position. 
3.13.3. (AFR Only) AFRC/CCC will approve the assignment of a member to a MSgt, SMSgt  or CMSgt position who is two or more grades below that authorized prior to assignment action  and regardless of status (IMA, TR, AGR, etc.).
28 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
3.14. Assignment of Family Members to Command or Supervisory Positions. All involved  in the assignment of personnel should watch for perceptions of preferential treatment or loss of  impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of the command and supervisory functions. Such  assignments can also have a negative impact on mission readiness. 
3.14.1. (RegAF and USSF Only) Assignment of family members to the same duty location  or unit are not prohibited, however, family members will not be assigned where one member  holds or potentially holds a command or supervisory position over another family member.  (T-3) Resolve situations at base level, if possible. When both members hold an AFSC or SFSC  requiring placement in the same unit or function, the unit commander working with the  assignment OPR initiates action to reassign one member to another unit or function on base in  an additional AFSC or SFSC. If neither member possesses an additional AFSC or SFSC,  submit a request for assignment disposition as outlined below. When a question of propriety  of assignment in circumstances other than those outlined herein exists, the case may be  forwarded for consideration as an exception. Send the case to AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO  and include the following information: 
3.14.1.1. Grade, name, and Social Security Number (SSN) (last 4) of members involved. 3.14.1.2. Family relationship. 
3.14.1.3. Circumstances that resulted in the command or supervision of one family  member by another (i.e., marriage, join spouse, humanitarian/Exceptional Family Member  Program (EFMP) assignment, school assignment, etc.). 
3.14.1.4. Efforts to resolve the case at base level. 
3.14.1.5. Recommendation of local commander. 
3.14.1.6. Each member’s PCS volunteer status and location preferences. 
3.14.2. (AFR Only) Do not create a situation in which one family member holds a command  or supervisory position over another family member. Within subordinate levels of an  organization, no supervisor will have a family member in the direct chain of  command/supervision. (T-1) There will be no waivers to accommodate any assignment that  would result in a possible conflict of command/supervision. 
3.14.2.1. Unit Program. If an individual is a Numbered Air Force (NAF) commander or  vice commander, no family member will be assigned to that NAF. Likewise, no family  member will be assigned to a wing, group, or squadron where a family member is the  commander or vice/deputy commander. (T-2)  
3.14.2.2. When these situations occur, the Career Development Element reassigns one  member to another unit or function on base in the same or a higher skill level AFSC or  additional AFSC, if possible. If units are unable to resolve situations, forward requests for  review through command channels to AFRC/A1 for final resolution. 
3.14.3. (ANG Only) Family members must be separated by at least two levels of supervision  within their unit (as defined by their Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS)). (T-2) This does  not preclude family members from being assigned within a subordinate organization.  Example: a state Command Chief Master Sergeant with a family member assigned within the  state is acceptable as it meets the rule for two levels of supervision between them.
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 29 
3.14.3.1. Prior to assignment, the unit commander must conclude there is neither a  potential conflict of interest nor the possibility of preferential treatment on the part of either  family member. (T-2) One family member cannot be in another family member’s rating  chain as first or second level rater/reviewer. (T-2) Reference AFI 36-2406, Officer and  Enlisted Evaluations Systems (Reg AF and ARC only) or SpFI 36-2401, Guardian  Evaluations Systems (USSF), when establishing rater/reviewer. 
3.14.3.2. Commanders are considered within the first level of supervision for all members  within their respective units. 
3.14.3.3. Command Chief Master Sergeants and first sergeants are considered within the  first level of supervision for all enlisted members within their respective units. 
3.14.3.4. A first sergeant at the group level must also meet the requirement of two levels  of supervision between the first sergeant and family member. (T-3)  
3.15. Assignment of Former Members of the Peace Corps. Former members of the Peace  Corps are not assigned permanent or temporary duty in the military intelligence field for a period  of four years following service with the Peace Corps. Members who later acquire an intelligence  specialty are not assigned in an intelligence capacity to any foreign country in which they  previously served as Peace Corps members. This limitation on the use of former Peace Corps  members cannot be waived. The term "former members of the Peace Corps" includes former  Peace Corps volunteers, volunteer leaders, and staff members of the Peace Corps. The term does  not include persons who attended Peace Corps training but never went overseas with the Peace  Corps. These persons are restricted from being assigned duties in an intelligence capacity only to  foreign countries for which they received Peace Corps training. (T-0) Reference Table 3.2 for  ALCs. 
3.16. Assignment of Members Who Were Previously Designated as “Missing” (Including  Prisoners of War/Missing In Action). Members placed in a “missing” casualty status as the  result of hostilities, either armed conflict or terrorist activities, are normally given an assignment  limitation upon their return to U.S. control. This limitation applies only to members who  subsequent to being declared missing are officially categorized as Missing, Missing in Action,  Captured (Prisoner of War), Beleaguered, Besieged, Detained (Hostage) or Interned as defined in  DAFI 36-3002, Casualty Services. 
3.16.1. The purpose of this provision is to limit assignment, TDY or PCS to areas where  members are not accessible to the same combatants, terrorists or nations sympathetic with the  combatants or terrorists. This limitation is void in the event of general mobilization. Members  may request the assignment limitation be removed; however, the limitation is not automatically  removed based solely on the member’s request. A request for removal may be disapproved  and the assignment limitation continued when the limitation is considered to be in the best  interest of the DAF (i.e., based on security considerations). When a member submits a request  for removal, the DAF will staff the request to determine if removal is appropriate and advise  the member and the member’s commander of approval or disapproval. (T-1)  
3.16.1.1. RegAF staffs requests to AFPC/DP3AM and USSF to ETMO 
3.16.1.2. AFR staffs requests to AFRC/A1. 
3.16.1.3. ANG staffs requests to NGB/A1.
30 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
3.16.2. (RegAF and USSF) The AFPC relocations office (AFPC/DP3AM), in conjunction  with the AFPC Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPFCS) and other activities, when  necessary, determines when action should be taken or continued in conjunction with this  paragraph to limit future assignment. Upon member’s return to U.S. control, AFPC/DPFCS  provides AFPC/DP3AM or ETMO a copy of DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty. In turn,  AFPC/DP3AM or ETMO will issue a memorandum as a source document, with the DD Form  1300 as an attachment, to the member’s unit commander and the member, directing update of  ALC “7” in the PDS. (T-1) The memorandum instructs the commander to contact and brief  the member on the assignment limitation. Unless the member requests, in writing, to  AFPC/DP3AM or ETMO that the limitation be removed and the removal request is approved,  then the member is restricted from PCS and/or TDY as stated above. Scan the correspondence  in the member’s electronic Automated Records Management System record. (T-1)  
3.17. (ARC only) Assignment of Members of the Retired Reserve. Members of the Retired  Reserve, who have not reached maximum service may request a Drill Status Guardsman, unit, or  IR assignment. If the gaining commander can define the unusual or unique circumstances that  may make the SecAF (or delegated authority) find the member’s service in the Ready Reserve to  be indispensable (10 USC § 10145, Ready Reserve: Placement In), and show they have no other  options available to fill a particular assignment, then the commander can have the member initiate  a request for assignment to the Ready Reserve to be submitted for AF/RE approval. 
3.17.1. Eligibility Requirements. Members must hold and be qualified in the AFSC, and  regular component retirees are required to be appointed into the ARC. (T-2) Members are also  not eligible for retraining, should be within five years of retiring, and members approved for  assignment in the AFR will be placed initially on a two-year contract with periodic reviews for  continuation unless AFR dictates otherwise. (T-2) Officers cannot have exceeded their  Mandatory Separation Date or age restrictions, and enlisted members cannot have exceeded  their High Year Tenure (HYT) date. 
3.17.2. Application Process. The member applies by submitting an application package to the  recruiter (AFR/ANG as applicable). An AFR recruiter will forward the application through  the gaining MPF to the unit commander for unit program assignment or the Readiness and  Integration Organization (RIO) Det/CC for the IR portfolio. (T-2) The Career Development  Element or RIO Det/CC will then forward the application through the NAF to Air Reserve  Personnel Center Assignments Division (ARPC/DPAA). (T-2) Requests to assign retired  colonels to Selective Reserve (SelRes) positions must be approved by AF/REG and through  RIO Det 5 for AFRC central managers for their IRs. An ANG recruiter will forward the  application through the gaining FSS and on to National Guard Bureau, Force Management  Branch (NGB/A1PP) after the request package has received an endorsement from The  Adjutant General (TAG), Commanding General (CG) or delegated authority (no lower than  the Director of Staff). (T-2) NGB/A1PP will forward the application through the ANG  Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services (NGB/A1) to NGB/CF for final  determination. The application package consists of the following: 
3.17.2.1. DAF 1288. 
3.17.2.2. Copy of the member’s retirement order. 
3.17.2.3. Statement from gaining commander that the member is qualified for the AFSC.
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 31 
3.17.2.4. Copies of the member’s last three Officer Performance Reports/Briefs or  Enlisted Performance Reports/Briefs. 
3.17.2.5. (ANG only) Copies of the signed letter from the gaining commander justifying  the assignment with manning statistics and TAG, CG, or delegated authority’s  endorsement. 
3.17.2.6. (ANG only) Record of current physical examination. 
3.17.2.7. (ANG only) NGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record  of Service, and DD Form 214, Certificate of Uniformed Service (if applicable). 
3.17.3. Removal Process Authority. ARPC/DPA is the authority for processing the removal  of a member of the Retired Reserve whose service has been defined as indispensable and a  Ready Reserve assignment request has been submitted and approved. Approved requests are  submitted to ARPC/DPAAA for the member’s removal from the Retired Reserve and  execution of reassignment orders. 
3.18. Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). 
3.18.1. EFMP Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Guidance. 
3.18.1.1. Waivers and exceptions to policy to these provisions require prior approval of  AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AFR), or NGB/A1 (ANG). The DAF  is committed to meeting the needs of this unique segment of our military community and  must be informed of the special needs of the member’s families. While dependent  parents/parents-in-law are not eligible for EFMP enrollment, member may request a  “courtesy clearance” for Continental United States (CONUS) assignment by contacting the  Special Needs Coordinator in the Military Treatment Facility (MTF). 
3.18.1.2. All members must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever  called upon to do so. (T-2) The DAF is also committed to equal distribution of overseas  assignments. As a result, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be  considered. If an EFMP reassignment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the  member must thereafter revert to worldwide assignable status. (T-2)  
3.18.1.3. The EFMP reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member  concerned. (T-3) A request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not  accepted. (T-3)  
3.18.1.4. An EFMP request is approved on its own merit and will not be disapproved based  solely on the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. A member is only  delayed from departing PCS when the member is required to remain for completion of  investigation and trial by U.S. military or civil authorities or administrative actions under  the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or DAFI 36-3211, Military Separations. When a reassignment request has been approved and administrative separation is not  deemed appropriate, the losing unit commander should formally notify the gaining unit  commander, in writing, of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and  provide a comprehensive analysis of the member’s job related or personal problems. 
3.18.1.5. For RegAF or USSF colonels and below (except those attending initial technical  training), requests must be submitted with supporting documentation via the virtual  Military Personnel Flight (vMPF). (T-2) For Air Force Cols (including Col selects), and 
32 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
CMSgts (including CMSgt selects) while requests are submitted initially to AFPC, the final  approval authority is AF/A1LO and AF/A1LE, respectively. For Space Force Cols, Col  selects, CMSgts, CMSgt selects, SMSgts, and SMSgt selects, the final approval authority  is SF/S1L. Requests will be provided to the appropriate OPR for consideration once the  required medical or legal review is obtained. Concerning RegAF or USSF, when  AFPC/DPFXAA is referred to, substitute AF/A1LO for RegAF colonels or colonel selects;  AF/A1LE for RegAF CMSgts and CMSgt selects; and SF/S1L for USSF colonels, colonels  selects, CMSgts, CMSgt selects, SMSgts, and SMSgt selects. For AFR members requests  are submitted to ARPC/DPA (lieutenant colonel and below) or AF/REG (Col and above).  For ANG members submit requests to NGB/A1P. 
3.18.1.6. RegAF and USSF members desiring EFMP deferment must submit their requests  through vMPF after receiving a Dependent Travel Approved (DTA) Family Member  Travel Screening determination in myVector. (T-2) ARC members desiring EFMP  deferment must submit their requests to their assignment authority prior to volunteering for  an assignment. (T-3) ARC Airmen serving in Title 10 for 30 or more days, desiring EFMP  deferment must submit their requests to their assignment authority prior to volunteering for  an assignment. (T-3)  
3.18.2. Considerations for the purpose of EFMP. 
3.18.2.1. Exceptional Family Member: Limited to the member’s spouse, child, or other  person actually residing in the member’s household who is dependent on the member for  over half of their financial support, and who meets DoDI 1315.19, The Exceptional Family  Member Program, criteria for enrollment in the EFMP. 
3.18.2.2. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC): A medical officer assigned to the MTF who  is appointed as the SNC by the MTF Commander. 
3.18.2.3. Family Member Relocation Clearance Coordinator: A medical technician or  civilian assigned to the MTF who is appointed as the Family Member Relocation Clearance  Coordinator by the MTF Commander. 
3.18.2.4. General Medical Services: Encompasses all types of physiological,  psychological, or social conditions of a chronic nature that have been medically diagnosed  and that require specialized treatment. 
3.18.2.5. Special Educational Services: Specially designed instruction to meet the unique  educational needs of a child with special needs or disabilities, including education provided  in school, at home, in a hospital or in an institution, physical education programs, and  vocational educational programs. 
3.18.2.6. Early Intervention and/or Related Services: DoDI 1342.12, Provision of Early  Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD Dependents, provides  guidance for early intervention and related services. Transportation and such  developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as required to assist a child, from  birth to 21 years, inclusive, with a disability to benefit from special education under the  child's Individualized Family Service Plan or Individualized Education Plan. Early  intervention and related services can include speech-language pathology and audiology,  psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation including therapeutic  recreation, early identification, and assessment of disabilities in children, counseling 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 33 
services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical  services for diagnostic or evaluative purposes. Special Education Services can also include  school health services, social work services, parent counseling and training. The sources  for these services are the home or community (natural setting), school (least restrictive  environment), and MTFs. 
3.18.2.7. Structural Accessibility: Encompasses design modification and enhancements  that permit safe access to or from military housing in accordance with the provisions of the  Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 USC § 4151, Building Defined). The immediate  non-availability of structural accessibility requirements at a projected location will not be  a limiting factor for assignment purposes. (T-3)  
3.18.2.8. Courtesy Clearance. A check of available medical services at the gaining  location MTF. Availability does not guarantee access to dependent parents/parents-in-law. 
3.18.3. Identifying and Reporting EFMP Conditions. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory  and requires the identification of all family members requiring long term general medical,  special educational, early intervention and related services, or modified housing. Members  with family members who require general medical, special educational, early intervention and  related services, or modified housing must contact the Special Needs Coordinator in the MTF  for a complete evaluation, assessment, and possible enrollment. (T-3) Likewise, the Special  Needs Coordinator must be advised immediately following the identification of a family  member who has a long-term condition requiring general medical, special educational, early  intervention and related services, or modified housing. (T-3) The DAF is committed to meeting  the needs of this unique segment of our military community and must be informed of the  special needs of the member’s families. While dependent parents/parents-in-law are not  eligible for EFMP enrollment, member may request a “courtesy clearance” for CONUS  assignment by contacting the Special Needs Coordinator in the MTF. 
3.18.3.1. Should EFMP conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification,  the member must report them to the Special Needs Coordinator and MPF immediately. If  appropriate, the member must submit their request to AFPC/DPFXAA within 30 calendar  days of learning of the condition (or a diagnosis). (T-3)  
3.18.3.2. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, or a  reassignment has been approved but the member has not departed, the member must notify  his MPF immediately. (T-3) An approved EFMP reassignment is normally canceled if the  situation for which granted ceases to exist before the member’s departure. In this instance  the member must provide information and supporting documentation to show what actions  have been taken regarding the reassignment. (T-3) The MPF will provide this information  AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AFR), or NGB/A1 (ANG) who will  make the final decision and provide a response by message. (T-2)  
3.18.3.3. A member must notify the MPF when the EFMP condition ceases to exist for  removal from the program. Once notified the MPF deletes the AAC, ALC, and deployment  availability code. (T-3)  
3.18.4. Spirit and Intent of the EFMP. EFMP actions are designed to help a member who has  a family member with special needs that meet DoD enrollment criteria. These problems are 
34 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
usually permanent or long term, and the family may need continued assistance. A member  may need EFMP assignment consideration throughout the member’s entire career. 
3.18.4.1. The EFMP is distinct from the humanitarian program and is based on the  personnel (manning) requirements of the Air Force or Space Force. The two programs are  not interchangeable and the EFMP should not be interpreted as a base of choice program.  The intent of the EFMP assignment guidelines are to use the member, based on current or  projected manning requirements, at locations where required medical, educational, early  intervention, or related services are available either through the military medical system,  through civilian resources utilizing TRICARE®, or a combination thereof and local  resources. AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AGR only), or NGB/A1  (ANG), in coordination with the AFPC Medical Staff, assignment OPR, and base level  Special Needs Coordinator, determines a suitable assignment. 
3.18.4.2. The EFMP provides an initial 12-month deferment for a newly diagnosed  condition when the member’s presence is essential in establishing and/or participating in  the treatment program. Deferment from reassignment may also be appropriate if a  treatment program is at a critical juncture and the member’s continued presence is essential  to continuing the treatment program. The EFMP also provides reassignment when a  member is assigned to an area and a new medical, special education, related service, or  early intervention need arises for which the needed services are not available within the  assignment locale. Once a treatment program is established, whether formally through the  EFMP or on the member’s own initiative, the member is then considered worldwide  assignable. 
3.18.4.3. Enrolling a family member in the EFMP does not negate the member’s  responsibility to serve their share of overseas duty or in meeting deployment requirements. 
3.18.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for EFMP Reassignment/Deferment. The member may be  provided an EFMP reassignment or deferment if (any) or (all) of the criteria are met: 
3.18.5.1. The member has a family member with a medical or educational requirement  that meets the DoD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP (ALC “Q” in the PDS). 
3.18.5.2. The Special Needs Coordinator has determined that adequate facilities/resources  to meet the family member’s medical, educational, related service, or early intervention  requirements do not exist and cannot be reasonably provided within the current assignment  locale. 
3.18.5.3. The member’s presence is determined to be essential in establishing,  participating in, or continuing a medical regimen or educational program in the present  area of assignment. Normally, only one deferment for the continuing condition of the same  family member is permitted and a TDY deferment (when determined necessary) is  normally only provided during the initial assignment deferment period. 
3.18.5.4. The member was denied family member travel by the gaining MTF based on  processing of the myVector Family Member Travel Screening (FMTS) application. A  FMTS application must be completed to the gaining location. AFPC/DPFXAA will assist  members with the reassignment options when a Dependent Travel not Approved is  received to the gaining location. (T-1) Deferment is not normally granted for this situation; 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 35 
however, cancellation of assignment may be provided or if the member is in a mandatory  PCS move status, an alternate assignment provided. 
3.18.6. Assignment Considerations for members with Exceptional Family Members.  Requests for EFMP consideration are submitted in the following circumstances: 
3.18.6.1. The member was denied family member travel (members projected to PCS  Continental United States (CONUS) to CONUS or overseas to CONUS) by the gaining  MTF based on processing of the myVector FMTS application. A FMTS application must  be completed to the gaining location. AFPC/DPFXAA will assist members with the  reassignment options when a Dependent Travel not Approved is received to the gaining  location. (T-1) Deferment is not normally granted for this situation; however, cancellation  of assignment is provided or, if the member is in a mandatory move status, an alternate  assignment will be provided. 
3.18.6.2. If serving overseas accompanied by command sponsored family members, a  member may request reassignment within the overseas theater if an unforeseen medical or  educational requirement arises after arrival at the overseas base. For an EFMP  reassignment within the same overseas theater, the member must agree to serve the full  prescribed tour length at the gaining location or a tour equal to the combined  unaccompanied tour lengths, whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the  theater. (T-0) Example: if serving on a 30/18-month overseas tour and approval is received  for assignment to a 36/24-month overseas tour, the member must serve the full prescribed  tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined  unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two locations before  reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the  greatest combined overseas tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time the member has been assigned to the current location. 
3.18.6.3. If serving overseas accompanied by command sponsored family members, a  member may request reassignment to the CONUS before DEROS if an unforeseen medical  or educational requirement arises after arrival at the overseas base and reassignment under  paragraph 3.18.6.2 is impractical. If the reassignment request is based on inadequate  medical or educational resources, the request must include the applicable medical  documentation from the local Special Needs Coordinator at the MTF. (T-2)  
3.18.6.4. If selected for a long tour regardless of volunteer status, and family member  travel is disapproved based on the unavailability of early intervention or related services  and/or special educational services, the member may seek to serve the unaccompanied long  tour or release from the assignment. To do this, the member must access the myVector  FMTS Dashboard to select a travel decision. AFPC/DPFXAA will assist members with the  reassignment options. (T-3) ARC members should consult with their assignment authority  in this situation. A copy of the AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and  Educational Clearance for Travel, Major Command Surgeon General (MAJCOM/SG)  determination, and other supporting documentation disapproving family member travel  must be included as attachments to the request for assignment cancellation. (T-3) However,  if a pinpointed assignment (a location with the required services) is identified by the  MAJCOM/SG, and a manning requirement exists at that location, a member selected as 
36 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
the most eligible non-volunteer will be required to proceed to the pinpointed assignment.  (T-3)  
3.18.6.5. If selected for an overseas long tour as a non-volunteer and family member travel  is disapproved based on the unavailability of general medical services (see paragraph 3.18.2), a member must access the myVector FMTS Dashboard to select a travel decision.  AFPC/DPFXAA will assist members with the reassignment options which may include the  member selecting the unaccompanied long tour or an unaccompanied short tour to  minimize family separation. ARC members should consult with their FSS authority in this  situation. If there are no current or projected short tour requirements available, the  unaccompanied long tour length must be served at the projected overseas location. (T-2)  After arrival overseas, the existing condition will not be considered in support of a  curtailment and early return to the CONUS unless the condition significantly worsens and  the member’s presence is considered essential as determined by the appropriate EFMP  official (e.g., medical, or educational personnel). 
3.18.6.6. If selected as a volunteer for an overseas long tour and family member travel is  disapproved for any reason, the member may seek to serve the unaccompanied long tour  or release from the assignment. The member must access the myVector FMTS Dashboard  to select a travel decision. AFPC/DPFXAA will assist members with the reassignment  options. (T-3) Although approval of the request is not automatic, every effort will be made,  and consideration given to approve such requests consistent with the needs of the DAF.  ARC members should consult with their assignment authority in this situation. 
3.18.6.7. If selected as a non-volunteer for an overseas short tour to an area where family  members are authorized, a member is required to serve the unaccompanied tour length  when family member overseas travel is denied, regardless of the reason. 
3.18.6.8. If selected for an overseas unaccompanied short tour (15 months or less),  members may and are encouraged to apply for a home-basing (HB) assignment  (Attachment 3) to effect continuation of the established EFMP. The request for HB should  include trailer remarks that state the member is applying to effect continuation of an  established EFMP. 
3.18.6.9. For members enroute PCS, they may discuss a potential EFMP issue with the  nearest MPF Chief, AFPC/DPFXXA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AFR), or NGB/A1  (ANG) personnel to assist in deciding whether to submit a request. There is no  reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base with an MPF  and a member's status remains unchanged (example: leave) if they decide to submit a  request. The member must comply with current reporting instructions if the Assignment  authority denies suspension of movement; however, a request still can be submitted. (T-2)  
3.18.7. Reasons EFMP Requests are Usually Disapproved. AFPC/DPFXAA may disapprove  requests for reassignment/deferment under the following circumstances: 
3.18.7.1. If the member caused or contributed to the commission of a FMTS violation,  either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval of family member  travel. Unless the member’s presence is essential, the family member should be returned  to the CONUS and the member must complete the overseas tour length prescribed based  on their status. (T-3) 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 37 
3.18.7.2. Reassignment when the member initially elects and proceeds on the  unaccompanied overseas tour at a location where family members are allowed and then,  after arrival, desires to change to an accompanied tour and the required medical or  educational resources are not available to meet his family members previously identified  special needs. 
3.18.7.3. Reassignment when the member circumvents or disregards the family member  clearance process by bringing non-command sponsored family members, at personal  expense, to an overseas location where the required medical resources do not exist to meet  their known needs. 
3.18.7.4. Reassignment to establish a treatment program based on the availability of a  preferred or optimal program in an area other than where currently assigned when adequate  facilities or services can be, or are, provided within the current locale. Also, EFMP  deferments are not granted for family members to remain in a preferred or optimal program  when adequate services are available within the projected assignment locale. 
3.18.7.5. Reassignment for the purpose of obtaining extended family support. 
3.18.7.6. Reassignment based on the availability of a free or lower cost program in an area  other than where currently assigned when the current duty location can provide adequate  services on base or through the local community. Exception: When required services are  being received off base and are causing a significant financial hardship, a member can  apply for reassignment as an exception to policy. Documentation provided with such a  request must clearly document the hardship. (T-3) This provision does not apply to a  dependent parent/parent-in-law since they are not eligible for coverage under TRICARE®. 
3.18.7.7. Reassignment based on the climatic conditions or geographical area adversely  affecting a family member’s health, and the problem is of a recurring nature (such as  asthma, allergies, eczema, etc.). Exception: Reassignment as an exception to policy can  be requested if the continued presence of the family member in such a climate/environment  is medically determined to be clearly life threatening. 
3.18.7.8. The request is based on mental disorders (i.e., anxieties, compulsions,  obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory manifestations or combinations thereof)  resulting from family separation incident to military assignment. 
3.18.7.9. A request based on an intellectually or athletically gifted child. Intellectually or  athletically gifted children do not qualify under the provisions of Public Law 95-561,  Defense Dependents’ Education Act of 1978, DoD instructions, and EFMP procedures. 
3.18.7.10. The family member is in an institution, unless institution officials certify  frequent and regular visits will be medically beneficial to the family member, or if  admittance to or retention in the institution requires establishing, continuing, or renewing  state residency. 
3.18.7.11. The disability is due to a short-term illness or injury, or when the prognosis for  complete recovery is satisfactory without the benefit of reassignment or deferment. 
3.18.7.12. Reassignment from the CONUS to overseas for the sole purpose of establishing  a treatment program.
38 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
3.18.7.13. A request for reassignment to a location with a greater capability to provide  space available care in a MTF for a member with a dependent parent/parent-in-law when  the required care is available within the current assignment locale. 
3.18.7.14. A request based on the medical condition of the member. Assignment for this  reason is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation warrants  such action. 
3.18.7.15. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been  selected and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request  for an officer can be considered based on the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable  Mover List (VML) if coordination with the appropriate assignment officer confirms  assignment selection is highly likely. 
3.18.7.16. Deferment from reassignment when the required resources are available within  the projected assignment locale. 
3.18.8. Processing EFMP Requests. Requests are submitted via vMPF in accordance with the  execution guidance in the myFSS website, Voluntary Assignments: EFMP Reassignment.  (T-3)  
3.18.8.1. Members should attach required documentation based on their reason for  request. 
3.18.8.2. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or evidence  of material value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete justification must  be provided. If the request is based on a spouse’s inability to manage the household in the  member’s absence due to unique family situations (as defined in DoDI 1342.19_AFI 36- 
2908), the commander’s endorsement must include information about the existence (or  lack thereof) of the documented family care plan required by DoDI 1342.19_AFI 36-2908.  (T-3)  
3.18.8.3. Members who are serving an accompanied overseas assignment that requests  reassignment based on medical, educational, related services or early intervention services  or early intervention services required for family members must provide applicable medical  documentation from the Special Needs Coordinator at the local MTF. (T-3)  
3.18.8.4. Both members of a military couple must submit a request if the same assignment  consideration is desired. When both apply, respective commander endorsements are  required. (T-3)  
3.18.8.5. The local Special Needs Coordinator must review and provide input on all EFMP  requests. Input must address the availability of required resources within the current  assignment locale. (T-3)  
3.18.8.6. The final approval/disapproval authority is AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and  USSF), ARPC/DPA (AGR only), or NGB/A1 (ANG). (T-2)  
3.18.9. Available Options When a Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved,  the MPF must counsel the member on the following options: members may apply (if eligible)  for retirement, retirement under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers)  resignation or release from active duty. For those who are pending reassignment, an EFMP 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 39 
request must be submitted within 7 calendar days following receipt of the correspondence  disapproving the deferment or reassignment request. (T-3)  
3.18.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw their request before a final  decision or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the  MPF or AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AGR only), or NGB/A1 (ANG)  immediately. Once a member has departed on an EFMP reassignment, the request can no  longer be withdrawn. (T-2) A request to withdraw an approved EFMP reassignment that was  provided based on either a lack of required medical resources within the current locale or on  environmental factors that were having a life-threatening effect on a family member will not  be favorably considered unless the situation has significantly changed since initial approval.  For this type of withdrawal request, input from the senior non-commissioned officer/Chief of  Medical Staff is required along with the member’s request. 
3.18.11. EFMP Assignment/TDY Restrictions. If a member is granted a reassignment or  deferment under the EFMP (AAC 34, Table 3.1), the member will not PCS during deferment  period for a maximum of 12 months from their Date Arrived Station, or date of approval not  to exceed 12 months. 
3.18.11.1. TDY restriction does not automatically apply to EFMP requests unless  specifically addressed in approval correspondence from AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and  USSF), ARPC/DPA (AGR only), or NGB/A1 (ANG). A member subject to TDY and  requesting a restriction must obtain a statement from the attending medical or therapy  provider. The statement must specify the need for the member’s presence and the duration  of the requirement. This statement must be submitted at the time of the request. A TDY  restriction request is normally approved only on an initial EFMP request. When a TDY  restriction is requested and approved, the MPF will place the member in deployment  availability code “44” as directed by AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA  (AGR only), or NGB/A1PP (ANG). (T-2)  
3.18.11.2. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration  of the assignment restriction, the member is considered for intra-command reassignment  to another organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on  base, or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by  AFPC/DPFXAA (RegAF and USSF), ARPC/DPA (AGR only), or NGB/A1 (ANG). 
3.18.12. myVector Family Member Travel Screening (FMTS) Application. All members with  a family member enrolled in the EFMP must complete the myVector FMTS application within  30 calendar days of assignment notification for any eligible PCS. (T-3) The FMTS application  and required documentation will be forwarded by the Special Needs Coordinator or Family  Member Relocation Clearance Coordinator at the member’s current duty location to the  coordinator at the projected assignment location to determine if adequate facilities will be  available for the member’s exceptional family members. If family member travel is denied,  see paragraph 3.18.6.1. 
3.18.12.1. As mandated by Public Law (Free Appropriate Public Education – FAPE),  public schools and early intervention services are required to provide appropriate  educational services. While mandated by FAPE, the DAF requires a member to process  the myVector FMTS application for a CONUS assignment. A non-recommendation for  family member travel from the gaining location’s Chief of Medical Staff will not result in 
40 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
cancellation of the assignment unless requested by the member. However, if the member  elects to continue with a CONUS assignment, the member may not later request EFMP  reassignment based on a lack of services (unless the request is based on a newly identified  need). 
3.18.12.2. All requests for reassignment or tour curtailment will normally be disapproved  when it is determined the member contributed to the commission of a myVector FMTS  Application by falsifying or omitting information. Unless the member’s presence is  deemed essential, their family members should be returned to the CONUS and the member  will be required to complete the remainder of the overseas tour established by the original  tour election. 
3.18.12.3. If it was determined that a member falsified or omitted information on the  myVector FMTS application, the investigation results will be provided to the losing and  gaining commanders by message for possible disciplinary action against a member who  caused or contributed to the commission of an myVector Family FMTS application  violation. 
3.19. Expedited Transfer. 
3.19.1. Expedited Transfer General Provisions/Guidance. 
3.19.1.1. The DAF offers expedited transfers to eligible members who file an unrestricted  report for sexual assault, stalking, or other sexual misconduct with the Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Office or the Family Advocacy Program. Members may request  an expedited transfer with assistance from the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response  Office, the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office, and  their commander. Additional guidance is available in DoDI 6495.02, Volume 1, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program Procedures, and DAFI 90-6001, Sexual  Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program. An expedited transfer request initiated  on behalf of another will not be accepted. 
3.19.1.2. The DAF offers expedited transfers to victims of stalking or other sexual  misconduct (i.e., indecent viewing, visual recording, or broadcasting; forcible pandering;  indecent exposure) and will file an unrestricted report with the Victim and Witness  Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office, and their commander. An expedited  transfer request initiated on behalf of another will not be accepted. 
3.19.1.3. The DAF offers expedited transfers to members whose adult military dependent  makes an allegation of non-domestic abuse sexual assault with the Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Office if the victim has filed an unrestricted report and the alleged  sexual assault offender is a Service member or if the alleged offender or alleged sexual  assault has a military nexus (e.g., adult military dependent, works for DoD as a civilian  employee (appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees, or is a government  contractor)), or the alleged sexual assault occurred on a DoD installation or facility.  Members may request an expedited transfer with assistance from the Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Office, the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in the  installation’s Legal Office, and their commander. Additional guidance is available in DoDI  6495.02, Under Secretary of Defense (USD) (Personnel and Readiness (P&R))  Memorandum, Revisions to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program’s 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 41 
Expedited Transfer Policy, and DAFI 90-6001. An expedited transfer request initiated on  behalf of another will not be accepted. 
3.19.1.4. The DAF offers expedited transfers to eligible members who are victims of  physical domestic violence committed by the spouse or intimate partner of the victim.  Members may request an expedited transfer with assistance from the installation Family  Advocacy Program Office, the Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate, and their commander.  Additional guidance is available in Section 536 of Public Law 115-232, National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019; DoDI 6495.02; and DAFI 90-6001. An expedited  transfer request initiated on behalf of another will not be accepted. 
3.19.1.5. Waivers and exceptions to policy to these provisions require prior approval of  the assignment authority (RegAF and USSF: AFPC/DPFXAA, ANG: NGB/A1PP, AFR:  ARPC/DPA (AGR), HQ RIO (IR), and AFRC/A1K (Traditional Reserve (TR)). (T-1)  
3.19.1.6. Members who were sexually assaulted and request transfer following threats of  bodily harm or death, should be encouraged to immediately report the threat to their  commander, law enforcement authorities, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response  Coordinator, Victim Advocate or Victims’ Counsel. The office receiving a request for  transfer based on threats of bodily harm or death must also immediately report the threat  to the member’s commander and law enforcement authorities. (T-0) Requests to transfer  under these circumstances for RegAF and USSF will be handled in accordance with  paragraph 6.54., Threatened Person Assignment Program. 
3.19.1.7. If the sexual assault of a civilian dependent occurred within the family or with  an intimate partner, reassignment requests will be considered under the Humanitarian  Assignments program (Attachment 15) when it is essential in establishing or operating an  effective Family Advocacy program according to DAFI 40-301, Family Advocacy  Program, DoDI 6400.01, Family Advocacy Program (FAP), and DoDI 6400.06, DoD  Coordinated Community Response to Domestic Abuse Involving DoD Military and Certain  Affiliated Personnel. (T-0) The Family Advocacy Program covers adult military dependent  sexual assault victims who are assaulted by a spouse or intimate partner and military  dependent sexual assault victims who are 17 years of age and younger. The installation  Family Advocacy Program and domestic violence intervention and prevention staff shall  direct coordination when a sexual assault occurs within a domestic relationship or involves  child abuse. 
Note: Reassignment requests by RegAF and USSF members who are sexually assaulted by a  family member or intimate partner, will be processed as an expedited transfer pursuant to DAFI  40-301. Note: A member’s commander can request assignment or assignment cancellation via  humanitarian deferment if the member needs to continue or obtain treatment for family advocacy  issues or when the member does not desire assignment or assignment cancellation, whichever  applies. The request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family Advocacy  Officer (see paragraph 7.5.9.2 for personnel assigned overseas). (T-3)  
3.19.1.8. Ordinarily only one expedited transfer may be approved for each qualifying  report. Subsequent expedited transfer requests will only be considered when the alleged  offender is later assigned to the same duty location as the member who filed the qualifying  report or when the victim is being retaliated against at the new duty station. (T-1) 
42 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
3.19.2. Expedited transfer for RegAF and USSF members. 
3.19.2.1. Requests are submitted and processed in accordance with DAFI 90-6001; see  execution guidance on Voluntary Assignments: Humanitarian Reassignment and  Deferment Program/Expedited Transfer Application in myFSS. Members are required to  meet normal assignment eligibility requirements as defined in this instruction. 
3.19.2.2. AFPC/DPFXAA will evaluate the member’s location preferences listed on the  wing (or equivalent) /delta commander’s memo and facilitate the reassignment. (T-2) If  preferences cannot be met based on Air Force or Space Force requirements, manpower  utilization, an exceptional family member’s needs, or member’s retainability per  paragraph 6.28.3., AFPC/DPFXAA will coordinate with the wing/delta commander on  viable alternatives to prevent negative impact on the member’s career and an exceptional  family member, if applicable. (T-2) If the installation or host wing (or equivalent)/delta  commander, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, Victim Witness Assistance Program  or Family Advocacy Program are aware the requester has a Victims' Counsel, they will  notify the Victims' Counsel of the Expedited Transfer decision and duty assignment. (T-2)  If location resolution cannot be obtained, the discussion will be resolved between Air  Force, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (AF/CVS) and AFPC/CC. (T-1) (RegAF  only) For colonels (including selectees), and CMSgts (including CMSgt selects), requests  will be submitted through AFPC to AF/A1LO or AF/A1LE for final determination on  reassignment location. (USSF only) For colonels (including selectees), CMSgts (including  CMSgt selects), and SMSgts (including SMSgt selects), requests will be submitted through  AFPC to SF/S1L for final determination on reassignment location. 
3.19.2.3. Reassignment from CONUS to an overseas location, or between/within overseas  theaters, should not be considered unless it has been documented that family members or  other identified support network reside in the overseas area and the requester has expressed a preference for transfer to the overseas location. Family members can be defined as  mother, father, siblings, and in loco parentis. Requests to relocate to locations where  family members other than those defined reside will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member’s foreign-born  spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in the  expedited transfer request. If reassignment can be facilitated, a request for a designated  location move to the native country must be processed per DAFI 36-3012, Military  Entitlements. (T-3)  
3.19.2.4. When a member is married to another member and desires join spouse  consideration, a join spouse intent letter must accompany the member's application in order  for the military spouse to also be considered for assignment action. 
3.19.2.5. A member desiring expedited transfer who has a spouse, or children enrolled in  the EFMP must complete the myVector FMTS application prior to finalization of the  assignment action. An expedited transfer reassignment cannot be approved unless the  projected assignment location can meet the needs of the exceptional family member in  accordance with paragraph 3.18. (T-3)  
3.19.2.6. A member will generally only be delayed from departing PCS when the member  is required to remain for completion of a criminal or disciplinary investigation or action in  which the member is the subject, including investigation and trial by U.S. military or civil 
DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 43 
authorities or administrative actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or DAFI  36-3211. If a member who has been approved for an expedited transfer has also undergone  past disciplinary action, but the commander does not deem a separation appropriate, the  losing unit commander must formally notify the gaining unit commander, in writing, of  any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive  analysis of the member’s duty related or personal problems related to the administrative or  disciplinary action. (T-3)  
3.19.2.7. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated after a member is  reassigned there due to an expedited transfer request, the member should be considered for  intra-command reassignment to another organization on the same base. If no authorization  for their specialty exists on base, or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment  instructions will be provided by AFPC/DPFXAA. 
3.19.2.8. Retraining or crossflow actions will be considered as a last resort. The primary  consideration is timely reassignment actions with minimal disruption to a member’s career.  All retraining actions will be coordinated through the AFPC Transitions, Retention and  Skills Management Branch (AFPC/DP3ST). As a rule, reassignment into a special duty  position is not considered since the selection process is under a nominative process and  requires additional training. Additionally, when a member requires reclassification prior  to expedited transfer assignment, AFPC/DPFXAA will process the reassignment action  once all reclassification actions are complete. (T-3)  
3.19.2.9. If a member submits a request for reassignment and the circumstances change  prior to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, the member must  immediately inform either the MPF or AFPC/DPFXAA. A message reply will be provided  with final disposition instructions. Once a member has departed on an expedited transfer  reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn. (T-3)  
3.19.3. Expedited transfer for AFR and ANG. 
3.19.3.1. The victim will forward the vice wing commander’s (or equivalent) memo (the  RegAF vice wing commander for IR), along with the expedited transfer application and all  documents related to the expedited transfer (to include the EFMP and other applicable PCS  documentation) to their unit commander or RIO Det/CC. (T-3) Upon receipt of an  expedited transfer request from the victim whose qualifying event occurred in the line of  duty, the member’s current unit commander will assist in fulfilling the member’s  reassignment request. (T-3) Reassignments within the ANG are subject to provisions of  Chief National Guard Manual CNGBM 1300.04, National Guard Expedited Transfer  Program for Members with Unrestricted Reports of Sexual Assault. ARC members  assigned on temporary active-duty orders away from home station who desire expedited  transfer from their temporary duty location will submit their request to the commander of  the unit to which they are providing support. (T-3)

(T-2) The vice  wing/delta commander (or equivalent) is required to consult with the servicing Staff Judge  Advocate and Military Criminal Investigative Organization in making this decision when  there is an open investigation. (T-2) Reassignment options include a temporary or PCA or  PCS to a location determined by DAF needs and if applicable, the EFMP requirements of  the alleged offender’s spouse or children. 
3.19.4.2. The Vice Wing/Delta Commander (or equivalent) will notify an alleged offender  who has been selected for expedited transfer. (T-2) The alleged offender will then have an  opportunity to submit through their unit commander their location preferences for inclusion  in the Vice Wing/Delta Commander’s (or equivalent) memorandum. (T-3) The alleged  offender will also have the opportunity to submit documentation of family member’s  enrollment in the EFMP, as well as any other circumstances relating to the reassignment  that the alleged offender desires to bring to the Vice Wing/Delta Commander’s (or  equivalent) consideration. (T-3) The alleged offender shall be notified in writing, that they  have the right to consult with an Area Defense Counsel prior to submitting these matters.  (T-3)  
3.19.4.3.

(T-2)  
3.19.4.3.1.2. If the Vice Wing/Delta Commander (or equivalent) is aware that the  requester has an Area Defense Counsel, they will also notify the Area Defense  Counsel. If location resolution cannot be obtained, AFPC/DPFXAA is the final  authority in determining location of reassignment. (T-3) 
46 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
3.19.4.3.1.3. When a member is married to another member and desires join spouse  consideration, a join spouse intent letter must accompany the member's application  in order for the military spouse to also be considered for assignment action. (T-2)

3.19.4.3.2. (ARC only) Parties involved in the reassignment process will execute  reassignment. (T-3)  
3.19.4.4. An alleged offender receiving an expedited transfer and has a spouse or  child(ren) enrolled in the EFMP must complete the myVector FMTS application prior to  finalization of the assignment action. An expedited transfer reassignment cannot be  approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the needs of the exceptional  family member in accordance with paragraph 3.18. (T-3)  
3.19.4.5. Reassignment from a CONUS to overseas location, or within/between overseas  theaters, should not be considered unless it has been documented that family members or  other identified support network reside in the overseas area and the requester has expressed  a preference for transfer to the overseas location. Family members can be defined as  mother, father, siblings, and in loco parentis. Requests to relocate to locations where  family members other than those defined reside will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member’s foreign-born  spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in the  expedited transfer request. If reassignment can be facilitated, a request for a designated  location move to the native country must be processed per DAFI 36-3012. (T-3)  
3.19.4.6. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated after a member is  reassigned there due to an expedited transfer request, the member should be considered for  intra-command reassignment to another organization on the same base. If no authorization  for their specialty exists on base, or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment  instructions will be provided by AFPC/DPFXAA for RegAF and USSF. 
3.19.4.7. AAC, ALC, and medical limitation codes must also be addressed prior to  reassignment. (T-3) The goal for transferring the alleged offender is a timely reassignment  with minimal disruption to a member’s career and family.

	b. An AAC does not preclude a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1 for definition of mandatory PCS), unless note 8 is  indicated for that code. 
2. Do not update for service members assigned overseas.  
3. Service member is not eligible to apply for any self-initiated assignment programs until the deferment has expired. A  service member who had an action approved under one of these programs before being placed in a code making them  ineligible may retain the previously approved action if expiration of the ineligibility condition is before the departure  date/DEROS. An RNLTD cannot be changed for the sole purpose of allowing a service member’s deferment to expire  before the departure date/DEROS (Includes when additional retainability is required due to change in PCS, TDY, or  training requirement). 
4. Does not apply to E-8s (USSF only), E-9s, O-6s and O-6 selects; do not update unless specifically authorized by  AF/A1LE or AF/A1LO (for RegAF) or SF/S1L (for USSF).  
5. If the enlisted service member refuses to obtain retainability to fulfill the Controlled Duty Assignment commitment or  Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) for directed training with a PCS, then the MPF will reclama the assignment.  6. As determined by AFI 51-402. 
7. Do not involuntarily extend service member’s DEROS. Retain service member in place, but allow DEROS to expire  (unless a voluntary DEROS extension is requested and approved).  
8. Includes mandatory PCS. 
9. This provision for civil court is only when a service member must appear as a material witness on behalf of any party in  connection with judicial proceedings to which the United States is a party. (T-1)  
10. Advise the assignment OPR with information addressee of AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO when placing the service  member in this code and PCS is mandatory.  
11. Requires assignment OPR approval prior to update of this code on a service member. The assignment action reason  for a PCS or other similar approval (such as a letter/memo, assignment trailer remarks, approved application, PCS orders,  and so on) may be used by MPF as authority for update of an AAC.  
12. Although every effort is made to ensure completion of the deferment period after retraining, the deferment may end  before the scheduled date in order to meet higher priority manning needs. AFPC/DP3AM or USSF/ETMO must approve  all waivers of the date of availability for FY service member retraining programs. AFPC/DPMOS must approve all  waivers of the date of availability for First Sergeants. Waiver authority for NCOs retraining under FY enlisted service  member retraining program and subsequently selected for RegAF CMSgt is AF/A1LE and USSF CMSgt and SMSgt is  SF/S1L. (T-1)  
13. Applies only to officers assigned to joint activities who are assigned to formally joint duty assignment positions. Does  not include officers assigned to joint activities in non-joint duty assignment positions. 
14. Enlisted service member receiving Overseas Tour Extension Incentive Program (OTEIP) pay may depart current  overseas location within the month and year of date of availability shown. 
15. Review DAFI 36-3012, for additional guidance.  
16. Review AFI 36-2113, The First Sergeant, for additional information and guidance. 
17. This code/date is solely used to identify a First Sergeant’s second or subsequent tour; this is not a deferment code to  stabilize to a specific location.  
18. Calculate date of availability by adding 12 months to the close out date of the referral performance report then update  date of availability as the 1st of the month following the 12 months for officers or the 1st of the month following the static  close out date for enlisted. Example: Referral Enlisted Performance Report for E-4 closed out on 18 July 2015, date of  availability is 1 April 2016 since the static close out date is 31 March. The code is removed when an service member’s  subsequent Officer Performance Report/Enlisted Performance Report is written that is not a referral report.

	Note: 
1. For adoption, see paragraph 3.8 and Table 3.2, ALC “S.”  
2. Service member is not eligible to apply for self-initiated assignment programs until the  deferment has expired. A service member who had an action approved under one of these  programs before being placed in a code making them ineligible may retain the previously  approved action if expiration of the ineligibility condition is before the departure date/DEROS.  
An RNLTD will not be changed for the sole purpose of allowing a service member’s deferment to  expire before the departure date/DEROS. (Includes when additional retainability is required due  to change in PCS, TDY, or training requirement). 
3. Includes Enlistment Bonus, Broken Service Selective Reenlistment Bonus, or Selective  Reenlistment Bonus. 
4. MPF update ALC “Q” only when instructed to do so by AFPC/DPFXAA or upon written  confirmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator that a service member has a family member  who meets DoD enrollment criteria for the EFMP. Delete the “Q” code only when instructed to do  so by AFPC/DPFXAA or upon written confirmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator that  the special needs no longer exist. 
5. A first-term Airman or Guardian selected as a volunteer for an extended long overseas tour can  delay obtaining retainability for a portion of the extended overseas tour until after arrival overseas.  See Table 6.5 and Table 7.11. The Total Force Service Center will input ALC “8” for approved  delays with expiration date of the projected tour completion date for the full extended tour. (T-1) The gaining overseas MPF will verify the projected tour completion date and correct as necessary.  Upon reenlistment, the DEROS automatically changes to reflect completion of the full prescribed  extended overseas tour length. (T-1)  
6. Requests to defer PCS reassignment for medical cause will initiate the review in lieu of Medical  Evaluation Board. If there is evidence that there has been a change in the service member’s  medical condition since the last Medical Evaluation Board, then the board will determine fitness  for continued service. If no clinical findings support a change in the service member’s condition,  the service member will PCS as directed. Generally approved for conditions that are static and  found as a result of medical records review and not incident to medical care. Temporary or mild  conditions requiring follow-up but clinically quiescent. 
7. Generally approved for temporary or mild conditions requiring follow-up but clinically  quiescent and managed without frequent visits or unique medication regimens or prescriptions. 8. Contact Air Force Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (AF/A10) for waiver authority.

3.20. Diverse Slates for Key Developmental Assignments and Non-Statutory Boards. The  DAF must work toward providing Key Developmental Assignments and Non-Statutory selection  boards with diverse pools of qualified candidates. Selection and hiring officials must promote  greater opportunity and consideration among qualified candidates, who offer diverse perspectives  and represent diverse backgrounds and experience. 
3.20.1. Key Developmental Assignments and Non-Statutory Boards will, to the extent  practicable, be composed of diverse slates and panel members under the DAF definition of  diversity per AFI 36-7001, Diversity & Inclusion. 
3.20.2. Key Developmental Assignments will have a diverse slate of at least one candidate  from an underrepresented group. For Non-Statutory Boards, a minimum of 30% of the slate  should be comprised of members from underrepresented groups. 
3.20.3. Hiring and selection officials will follow procedures as outlined in Attachments 18 and  19, respectively. 
3.21. Return to Service and Interim Member Transfer (RTS/IMT) Programs. The return to  service (RTS) program is for the permanent reassignment and the interim member transfer (IMT)  program is for the interim (temporary) reassignment of members relieved of duty, for cause or not  for cause, who are assigned or attached to HAF, the Office of the SecAF, the JCS, the DoD, the  OSD, and to those whose organization is not subordinate to a MAJCOM/FLDCOM and who are  not administratively assigned to an installation with an DAF commander authorized to exercise  general or special court-martial convening authority. 
3.21.1. AFPC/DP3AM is the OPR for the RTS/IMT programs. 
3.21.2. The AFDW, A1 Directorate (AFDW/A1) is designated as the National Capitol Region  OPR on all matters relating to the return to service and RTS/IMT programs. AFDW/A1 is  responsible for generating AFDW guidelines and procedures governing the RTS/IMT  programs, which includes supplements to this publication and forms. AFDW/A1 coordinates  with AFPC/DP3AM regarding placement of members, either on a temporary or permanent  basis, within the context of the program. 
3.21.3. Members eligible to PCS (do not have disciplinary or medical processing actions  pending) are reassigned under the return to service program to an Air Force unit in the CONUS  (based on the manning needs of the Air Force at the time the member is relieved). RNLTDs  are established as 60 days from the date the member is relieved of duty. The 60 days provides  ample time for the member to complete all out-processing actions and report to the designated  base since the member is no longer performing duties based on being relieved. 
3.21.4. Members not eligible to PCS (have disciplinary or medical processing actions  pending) are reassigned under the RTS/IMT program to Air Force District of Washington as  an interim measure to facilitate certain medical, administrative, or disciplinary actions. Upon  completion of the disciplinary or medical processing action the member is reassigned under  the return to service program, if not separated from service.

Chapter 4 
TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) ASSIGNMENT 
4.1. Purpose of TDY. In accordance with 37 USC § 474, Travel and Transportation Allowances:  General, and the JTR, this instruction authorizes members to be temporarily assigned to perform  duty at a location other than their current permanent duty station for the following reasons: at a  location other than their current permanent duty station in support of requirements for their next  PCS assignment, for administrative reasons, and manning assistance. 
4.1.1. This instruction prescribes policies, procedures, restrictions, and guidance for selection  and effective management of members TDY for these reasons only: 
4.1.1.1. TDY (as related to a PCS assignment action) which is not authorized by this  instruction or some other DAF, Air Force, or Space Force instruction may be submitted for  consideration as an exception according to paragraph 5.5. Exceptions are requested and  the TDY authorized in advance. Authorization of TDY as an exception does not include  funding. The availability of funding may not be the sole basis for authorization of TDY.  TDY authorized as an exception is on the basis that TDY serves the best interests of DAF.  TDY in accordance with this instruction, including as an exception, cannot be authorized  solely for personal reasons. 
4.1.1.2. Administrative TDY is used only for official military reasons to advise or  participate in such activities as briefings, lectures, staff assistance, meetings, conferences,  or to attend a course of instruction of less than 20 weeks. Before directing TDY, officials  should be convinced TDY is essential and the results pay back DAF for the cost of the  TDY. Further, the cost in terms of unit, member, and family turbulence associated with  TDY is considered and the TDY deemed essential to satisfy the needs of the DAF. 
4.1.1.3. Manning assistance TDY may be used to satisfy one-time operational manning  requirements of short duration or to satisfy long-term operational manning requirements  on a temporary basis while PCS arrangements are completed. 
4.1.2. TDY for other reasons, such as Air Force/US Space Force deployment and  redeployments that support Combatant Commander (CCDR) Global Demands, i.e., campaign  plans (CCP & UCP), military operations, rotational force planning (allocated forces/JIA), joint  exercises, and potential military operations (future operations), to appear as a witness, for  medical evaluation, permissive temporary duty, and so on, is not authorized under the authority  of this instruction. The authority for that type TDY, funding authorization, criteria for selection  of members (if applicable), and so on, should be addressed in the instruction which authorizes  TDY for those purposes. Permissive Temporary Duty is authorized and approved according  to the criteria in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. Air Force and Space Force  deployments, and exercise TDYs are authorized and approved according to the criteria in DAFI  10-401, Operations Planning and Execution, AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and  Execution and DAFI 36-3802. 
4.2. Delegation of Temporary Duty (TDY) Assignment Authority. TDY assignment authority  is decentralized for administrative TDY and is hereby delegated to MAJCOMs, FLDCOMs, or  equivalent. As used here, the term equivalent includes the headquarters of Field Operating  Agencies, direct reporting units, and the headquarters level of those other functions which have 
80 DAFI36-2110 9 AUGUST 2024 
been assigned a MAJCOM or FLDCOM Identity Code as shown in the PAS Directory. A  MAJCOM or FLDCOM (or equivalent) may further delegate TDY authority to and including  squadron level. A MAJCOM or FLDCOM (or equivalent) may limit TDY authority it delegates.  Example: a MAJCOM or FLDCOM may limit locally originated TDY to within the CONUS only. 
4.3. TDY Allowances and Orders. The DAF is obligated to pay TDY allowances as prescribed  by the JTR to members who are ordered to perform temporary duties away from their home station  (regardless of distance). If necessary, the Financial Services Office (FSO) should determine what,  if any, TDY allowances accrue according to the JTR. TDY orders are issued according to AFI 65- 
103, Temporary Duty/Special Orders. Permissive Temporary Duty is authorized and approved  according to the criteria in AFI 36-3003. 
4.4. When to Request PCS or Authorize TDY. When a MAJCOM or FLDCOM (or equivalent)  has an operational mission which exists at a specific location for more than 180 consecutive days,  consideration should be given to establishing a permanent Air Force or Space Force unit at that  location, allocation of manpower authorizations and accomplishment of the mission by assignment  of members in PCS status. For assignment planning purposes, the 179-day guideline should be  used in determining which missions can be accomplished with a TDY and which should be  accomplished with a PCS. Determining the exact length of time needed to accomplish a mission  or PCS assignment to a specific location may not be feasible; therefore, long-term TDY, in  compliance with paragraph 4.6.1, may be necessary. Note: When the prerequisites for PCS of  members have been completed, then a MAJCOM or FLDCOM (or equivalent) may request the  assignment OPR assign members on a PCS basis (see paragraphs 4.2, 5.5.3, and 7.5.). 
4.5. Determining TDY or PCS to Attend a Course of Instruction. The JTR, par. 032201,  establishes that when a member is to attend a course(s) of instruction of less than 20 calendar  weeks, then attendance is in TDY status (use the duration of the course(s) as shown in Air Force  Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) (https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/app10- etca/SitePages/Course.aspx?ao=1&i=5135&isdlg=1) at any one location, or total duration of  courses when attending two or more courses at the same location). Exception: Assign enlisted  members graduating from basic training to school in PCS status if assigning them directly to a  technical school regardless of the course length. The length of TDY cannot exceed the number of  calendar days from the course reporting date to the final graduation date as shown in the quota  allocation, plus all allowable travel time. Conversely, when a member attends a course (or courses)  at one location and the official length of the course(s) is 20 weeks or more, then the member attends  in PCS status. When a member’s attendance status is TDY, but the member remains at a location  for 20 weeks or more (example: if a member is ordered to repeat a block of training), the original  attendance status of TDY based on the course length is not changed from TDY to PCS. Similarly,  when a member’s attendance status is PCS based on the course length and the member completes  the course (or is eliminated) in less than 20 weeks, the original attendance status of PCS is not  changed to TDY. Upon determining attendance is in a TDY status, then see paragraphs 4.6 and  6.31.5., Table 4.1, and paragraph 7.6. 
4.6. TDY Restrictions. A number of the TDY assignment policies and procedures outlined in  this instruction have been established to specifically comply with, or to comply with the intent of,  Comptroller General Decisions or the JTR. Erroneous payments to members (regardless of how  the error occurred) are normally recouped as soon as the error is discovered. Further, it is not  always possible to correct errors administratively when they involve allowances. Accordingly,  commanders at all levels and officials responsible for directing and/or approving TDY should be
